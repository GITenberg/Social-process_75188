<p class='c012'>ADAPTIVE GROWTH—PERSONAL AND IMPERSONAL FORMS—IMPERSONAL
FORMS ARE ALIVE—INTERMEDIATE FORMS—THE TENTATIVE
PROCESS—ILLUSTRATIONS OF TENTATIVE GROWTH—ORGANIC
TENDENCY—THE KINDLING OF MIND</p>

<p class='c010'>We see around us in the world of men an onward
movement of life. There seems to be a vital impulse, of
unknown origin, that tends to work ahead in innumerable
directions and manners, each continuous with something
of the same sort in the past. The whole thing
appears to be a kind of growth, and we might add that
it is an <em>adaptive</em> growth, meaning by this that the forms
of life we see—men, associations of men, traditions, institutions,
conventions, theories, ideals—are not separate
or independent, but that the growth of each takes place
in contact and interaction with that of others. Thus
any one phase of the movement may be regarded as a
series of adaptations to other phases.</p>

<p class='c013'>That the growth of persons is adaptive is apparent to
every one. Each of us has energy and character, but not
for an hour do these develop except by communication
and adjustment with the persons and conditions about
us. And the case is not different with a social group,
or with the ideas which live in the common medium of
communicative thought. Human life is thus all one
growing whole, unified by ceaseless currents of interaction,
but at the same time differentiated into those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>diverse forms of energy which we see as men, factions,
tendencies, doctrines, and institutions.</p>

<p class='c010'>The most evident distinction among these growing
forms is that between the personal and the impersonal.
A man is a personal form of life; a fashion or a myth is
impersonal. This seems obvious enough, but there are
cases in which the line is not so plain, and it may be well
to consider more precisely what we mean by “personal”
in this connection, or rather in just what sense a form of
human life can be impersonal.</p>

<p class='c013'>An impersonal form, I should say, is one whose life
history is not identified with that of particular persons.
A myth, for example, has a history of its own which you
would never discover in the biography of individuals,
and although it exists in the minds of men it cannot be
seen intelligibly except by regarding it as a distinct whole
for which human thought is only a medium. When an
American Indian, let us say, repeated with unconscious
variations the story of Hiawatha, he did not know he
was participating in the growth of a myth; that was
taking place in and through him but quite apart from
his personal consciousness. The same is true of the
growth of language. We know that the speech of any
people has a vital unity, offering to the philologist a
world of interesting structures and relations of which
those who use the language and contribute to its growth
are as unaware as they are of the physiology of their
bodies. The difference between personal and impersonal
organisms, then, is above all practical, resting upon the
fact that many forms of life are not identified with personality
and cannot be understood, can hardly be seen
at all, by one who will interest himself only in persons.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>They exist in the human mind, but to perceive them
you must study this from an impersonal standpoint.</p>

<p class='c013'>Observe the practical value, if we hope to do away
with war, of perceiving that the chief opponent of peace is
something far more than any one group of men, like the
Prussian aristocracy, namely militarism, an international
organism existing everywhere in the form of aggressive
ideals, traditions, and anticipations. If we can learn to
see this, and see how we ourselves, perhaps, are contributing
to it by our ignorance of foreign nations and our
lack of generous ideals for our own, we are in a position
to oppose it effectually.</p>

<p class='c013'>We live, in fact, in the very midst of a rank growth of
social structures of which, since they are impersonal and
do not appeal to our interest in personality, we are mainly
unaware. We can see that such a growth has taken
place in the past, and there is no reason to suppose that
it has ceased. The development of religious institutions
during the past thirty years has involved gradual changes
in belief about such matters as immortality, salvation,
and the relation of God to man, of which we have not
been aware because they have not been the work of definite
thought and discussion, for the most part, but have
been borne in upon us by the mental currents of the time.
We do not even now know precisely what they are; but
they are real and momentous, and it is of such changes
that the development of institutions chiefly consists.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is noteworthy that however impersonal a phase of
social growth may be it appeals to our interest as soon as
we see that it has a life history, as one may find
amusement in following the history of a word in one
of the books of etymology. There is something in
the course of any sort of life that holds our attention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>when we once get our eye upon it. How willingly do we
pursue the histories of arts, sciences, religions, and philosophies
if some one will only show us how one thing
grows out of another.</p>

<p class='c010'>To say that a social form is impersonal does not mean
that it is dead. A language or a myth is verily alive;
its life is human life; it has the same flesh and blood
and nerves that you and I have, only the development of
these is organized along lines other than those of personal
consciousness. When I speak, or even when I think,
language lives in me, and the part that lives in me is
acting upon other parts living in other persons, influencing
the life of the whole of which I am unconscious. And
the same may be said of tradition, of the earlier and less
conscious history of institutions, and of many obscure
movements of contemporary life which may prove important
notwithstanding their obscurity.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is evident that the personal and the impersonal
forms must overlap, since the same life enters into both.
If you took away all the persons there would be nothing
left, the other systems would be gone too, because their
constituents are the same. What we may not so readily
admit (because of our special interest in personality) is
that persons are equally without a separate existence,
and that if you take away from a man’s mind all the
unconscious and impersonal wholes there would be nothing
left—certainly no personality. The withdrawal of
language alone would leave him without a human self.</p>

<p class='c010'>Between persons, on the one hand, and those forms of
life that are wholly impersonal, on the other, there are
many intermediate forms that have something of both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>characteristics. A family is perhaps as personal as any
group can be, because its members so commonly identify
their personality with it, but it may easily have an organic
growth of its own to which its members contribute
without knowing. Every family has in greater or less
degree a moral continuity from generation to generation
through which we inherit the influence of our great grandfathers,
and there is none of which a history might not
be written, as well as of the Stuarts or Hohenzollerns, if
we thought it worth while.</p>

<p class='c013'>A small, closely knit community, like a primitive clan,
or like a Jewish colony in a Russian village, has a corporate
life of much the same personal character as the family;
that is, the group comprehends almost the whole personality
of the individuals, and is not too large or too
complex for the individual to comprehend the group.
Larger communities and even nations are also thought of
as aggregates of persons, but they have a life history that
must be seen as a whole and can never be embraced in
any study of persons as such.</p>

<p class='c013'>Most of the voluntary associations of our modern life
are of a character chiefly impersonal; that is they tend to
a specialization by which one interest of the individual is
allied with the similar interests of others, leaving his
personality as a whole outside the group. The ordinary
active citizen of our day joins a dozen or more organizations,
for profit, for culture, for philanthropy, or what-not,
into each of which he puts only a fragment of himself,
and for which he feels no serious responsibility. It
is very commonly the case, however, that one or a few
individuals—zealous employees or unpaid enthusiasts for
the cause—do identify themselves with the life of the
association and put personality into it. And this may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>happen with those social growths which we have noticed
as peculiarly impersonal—even with language, as when an
enthusiast sets out to revive Irish or promote Volapük.</p>

<p class='c013'>May we not say, indeed, that whenever two persons
associate we have a new whole whose life cannot altogether
be understood by regarding it merely as the sum
of the two? This is clearly the case with husband and
wife, and no doubt, in measure, with other relations.</p>

<p class='c010'>If we inquire more closely into the interaction and
growth of these forms of life we come upon what I will
call the tentative process. This is no other than what is
vaguely known to popular thought as the process of evolutionary
“selection,” or the survival of the fittest, and is
also described as the method of trial and error, the pragmatic
method, the growth of that which “works” or
functions, and by other terms similar to these. Perhaps
as simple a description as any is to say that it is a process
of experiment which is not necessarily conscious. That
is, the trial of various activities and the guidance of behavior
by the result of the trial may require no understanding
of what is taking place.</p>

<p class='c013'>The growth of social forms is for the most part roughly
analogous to that of the wild-grape vine which has extended
itself over trellises and fences and into trees in
my back yard. This vine has received from its ancestry
a certain system of tendencies. There is, for example,
the vital impulse itself, the general bent to grow. Then
there is its habit of sending out straight, rapidly growing
shoots with two-branched tendrils at the end. These
tendrils revolve slowly through the air, and when one
touches an obstacle, as a wire or branch, it hooks itself
about it and draws up in the form of a spiral spring,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>pulling the shoot up after it. A shoot which thus gets
a hold grows rapidly and sends out more tendrils; if it
fails to get a hold it by and by sags down and ceases to
grow. Thus it feels its way and has a system of behavior
which insures its growth along the line of successful
experiment.</p>

<p class='c013'>So in the human world we find that forms of life tending
to act in certain ways come into contact with situations
which stimulate some of their activities and repress
others. Those that are stimulated increase, this increase
acts upon the structures involved in it—usually to augment
their growth—and so a “selective” development is
set in motion. Intelligence may have a part in this or
it may not; nothing is essential but active tendencies
and conditions which guide their operation.</p>

<p class='c013'>You may sometimes see one vine growing upon another,
involving the mutual adaptation of two living forms.
In human life this is the usual condition, the environment
being not something fixed but another plastic organism,
interacting in turn with still other organisms, giving rise
to an endless system of reciprocal growth. One form of
life feels about among the various openings or stimuli
offered by another, and responds to those which are most
congruous with its own tendencies. The two experiment
with each other and discover and develop some way,
more or less congenial, of getting along. This is evidently
true of persons, and the principle applies equally to groups,
ideas, and institutions.</p>

<p class='c013'>We have, at any given moment, a complex of personal
and impersonal wholes each of which is charged with
energy and tendency in the form of heredity and habit
coming from its past. If we fix our attention upon any
particular whole—a person, a party, a state, a doctrine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>a programme of reform, a myth, a language—we shall
find it in the act of making its way, of growing if it can, in
the direction of its tendencies. As we have seen, it is
alive, however impersonal, and has human flesh, blood,
and nerves to urge it on. It already has adapted structure—hands
and feet as Luther said of the Word of God—because
if it had not developed something of the sort,
some fitness to live in the general stream of human life,
we should not in fact find it there. As its means of
further growth it has a repertory of available activities;
and these, consciously or otherwise, are tried upon the
situation. If not guided by something in the nature of
intelligence they act blindly, and may nevertheless act
effectively. In general some one or some combination
of these activities will work better in the situation than
others, finding more scope or stimulus of some sort, and
will grow accordingly; the energies of the whole, so far
as they are available, tending to find an outlet at this
point. Thus the more a thing works the more it is
enabled to work, since the fact that it functions draws
more and more energy to it. And the whole to which it
belongs, in thus continuing and enhancing the successful
activity, behaves very much as if it were conducting
a deliberate experiment. The enhanced activity also involves
changes in the whole and in the situation at large;
and thus we move on to new situations and new operations
of the same principle.</p>

<p class='c010'>Take, for illustration, the growth of a man at any
point of his career; let us say a youth starting out to make
his living. He has energies and capacities of which he
is for the most part but vaguely aware. Young people
wave their instincts and habits about for something to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>catch on very much as a vine does its tendrils. Suggestions
as to possible lines of work, drawn from what he
sees about him, are presented to his mind and, considering
these with such light as he may have, he seeks a job.
He selects as among his opportunities, and at the same
time his opportunities, in the form of possible employers,
select as between him and other seekers. Having undertaken
a job he may find that he cannot do the work, or
that it is too repugnant to his inclinations, in which case
he presently drops it and tries another. But if he succeeds
and likes it his energy more and more flows into it,
his whole mind is directed toward it, he grows in that
sense. And his success usually secures to him a larger
and larger part to play in his chosen field, thus opening
new opportunities for growth in the same direction. Life
is constantly revealing openings which we could not have
anticipated. It is like paddling toward the outlet of a
lake, which you cannot locate until you are almost in it.
We think that our course must extend in one of two directions;
but further advance shows that there is a third
more practicable than either. A little idea that we have
overlooked or deemed insignificant often grows until it
renders obsolete those we thought great.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the case of a group under personal leadership the
process is not greatly different. A political party, a business
enterprise, a social settlement, a church, a nation,
develops by means of a mixture of foresight and unforeseen
experience. It feels its way, more or less intelligently,
until it finds an opening, in the form of policies
that prove popular, unexploited markets, neglected wrongs,
more timely doctrines, or the like; and then, through increased
activity at the point of success, develops in the
propitious direction.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Fashion well illustrates the tentative growth of an
impersonal form. Thus fashions in women’s dress are
initiated, it appears, at Paris, this city having a great
prestige in the matter which it has achieved by some centuries
of successful leadership. In Paris there are a
large number of professional designers of dress who are
constantly endeavoring to foresee the course of change,
and to produce designs that will “take.” They compete
with one another in this, and those who succeed gain
wealth and reputation for themselves and the commercial
establishments with which they are connected. Although
they initiate they by no means have the power to do this
arbitrarily, but have to adapt themselves to vague but
potent tendencies in the mind of their public. It is their
business to divine these and to produce something which
will fit the psychological situation. At the seasons when
new styles are looked for the rival artists are ready with
their designs, which they try upon the public by causing
professional models, actresses, or other notabilities to
appear in them. Of the many so presented only a few
come into vogue, and no designer can be certain of success:
no one can surely foresee what will work and what
will not. But the designs that win in Paris spread almost
without opposition over the rest of the fashionable earth.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the sphere of ideas “working” is to be understood
as the enhanced thought which the introduction of an
idea into the mental situation may stimulate. An idea
that makes us think, especially if we think fruitfully, is a
working idea. In order to do this it must be different
from the ideas we have, and yet cognate enough to suggest
and stimulate a synthesis. When this is the case
the human mind, individual or collective, is impelled to
exert itself in order to clear the matter up and find an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>open way of thinking and acting. Thus it strives on to
a fresh synthesis, which is a step in the mental growth of
mankind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Consider, for example, the working of the idea of evolution,
of the belief that the higher forms of life, including
man, are descended from lower. A pregnant, widely
related idea of this sort has a complex growth which is
ever extending itself by selection and adaptation. We
know that various lines of study had united, during the
earlier half of the nineteenth century, to make it appear
to bold thinkers that evolution from lower forms was not
improbable. This idea found a point of fruitful growth
when, in the thought of Darwin especially, it was brought
into contact with the geological evidence of change and
with the knowledge of heredity and variation accumulated
by breeders of domestic species. Here it worked so vigorously
that it drew the attention and investigation first of
a small group and later of a great part of the scientific
thought of the time. Other ideas, like that of Malthus
regarding the excess of life and the struggle for existence,
were co-ordinated with it, new researches were undertaken;
in short, the public mind began to function largely
about this doctrine and has continued to do so ever since.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just what is it that “works”? The idea implies that
there is already in operation an active tendency of some
sort which encounters the situation and whose character
determines whether it will work there, and if so, how.
In the case of the vine it is the pre-existing tendency of
the tendrils to revolve in the air, to bend themselves
about any object they may meet, and then to draw together
like a spiral spring, which causes the vine to work
as it does when it meets the wire. Indeed, to explain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>fully its working many other tendencies would have to
be taken into account, such as that to grow more rapidly
at the highest point attained, or where the light is greatest,
and so on. In fact the vine has an organism of correlated
tendencies whose operation under the stimulus of
the particular situation is the working in question.</p>

<p class='c013'>When we speak of human life we are apt to assume that
the existing tendency is some conscious purpose, and that
whatever goes to realize this is “working,” and everything
else is failure to work. In other words, we make
the whole matter voluntary and utilitarian. This is an
inadequate and for the most part a wrong conception of
the case. The working of a man, or of any other human
whole, in a given situation is much more nearly analogous
to that of the vine than we perceive. Although conscious
purpose may play a central part in it, there is also a whole
organism of tendencies that feel their way about in the
situation, reacting in a complex and mainly unconscious
way. To put it shortly, it is a man’s character that
works, and of this definite purpose may or may not be
a part.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a similar way any form of human life, a group, institution,
or idea, has a character, a correlation of complex
tendencies, a <i><span lang="de">Motiv</span></i>, genius, soul or whatever you may
choose to call it, which is the outcome of its past history
and works on to new issues in the present situation.
These things are very little understood. How a language
will behave when it has new forms of life to interpret
will depend, we understand, upon its “genius,” its historical
organism of tendencies, but I presume the operation
of this is seldom known in advance. And likewise
with our country as it lives in the minds of the people,
with our system of ideas about God and the church, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>about plants and animals. These are real forms of life,
intricate, fascinating, momentous, sure to behave in remarkable
ways, but our understanding of this branch of
natural history is very limited. The popular impression
that nothing important can take place in human life
without the human will being at the bottom of it is an
illusion as complete as the old view that the universe
revolved about our planet.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here is an example from Ruskin of the working of two
styles of architecture in contact with each other. He
says that the history of the early Venetian Gothic is
“the history of the struggle of the Byzantine manner
with a contemporary style [Gothic] quite as perfectly
organized as itself, and far more energetic. And this
struggle is exhibited partly in the gradual change of the
Byzantine architecture into other forms, and partly by
isolated examples of genuine Gothic taken prisoner, as
it were, in the contest; or rather entangled among the
enemy’s forces, and maintaining their ground till their
friends came up to sustain them.” The reality of such
struggles and adaptations cannot be gainsaid by any one
acquainted with the history of art, nor the fact that they
are the outworking of complex antecedent tendencies.
But I suppose that all the individual builder perceived of
this conflict was that men from the north were making
window-mouldings and other details in new forms which
he could use, if they pleased him, instead of other forms
to which he had been accustomed. Of either style as an
organic whole with more or less energy he probably knew
nothing. But they were there, just as real and active as
two contending armies.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>One may sometimes discover in his own mind the working
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>of complex tendencies which he has not willed or understood.
When one first plans a book he feels but vaguely
what material he wants, and collects notes somewhat at
random. But as he goes on, if his mind has some synthetic
energy, his thought gradually takes on a system,
complex yet unified, having a growth of its own, so that
every suggestion in this department comes to have a
definite bearing upon some one of the many points at
which his mind is striving to develop. Every one who
has been through anything of this sort knows that the
process is largely unintentional and unconscious, and that,
as many authors have testified, the growing organism
frequently develops with greatest vigor in unforeseen
directions. If this can happen right in our own mind,
with matters in which we have a special interest, so much
the more can it with lines of development to which we
are indifferent.</p>

<p class='c010'>As a matter of psychology the evident fact underlying
this “working” is that mental development requires the
constant stimulus of fresh suggestions, some of which
have immensely more stimulating power than others.
We know how a word or a glance from a congenial person,
the quality of a voice, a poetic or heroic passage in a book,
a glimpse of strange life through an open door, a trait of
biography, a metaphor, can start a tumult of thought and
feeling within us where a moment before there was only
apathy. This is “working,” and it seems that something
like it runs all through life. It is thus that Greek literature
and art have so often awakened the minds of later
peoples. The human spirit cannot advance far in any
separate channel: there must be a group, a fresh influence,
a kindred excitement and reciprocation.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>These psychical reactions are more like the kindling
of a flame, as when you touch a match to fine wood, than
they are like the composition of mechanical forces. You
might also call it, by analogy, a kind of sexuality or mating
of impulses, which unites in a procreative whole
forces that are barren in separation.</p>

<p class='c013'>This kindling or mating springs from the depths of
life and is not likely to be reduced to formulas. We can
see, in a general way, that it grows naturally out of the
past. Our primary need is to live and grow, and we are
kindled by something that taps the energies of the spirit
where they are already pressing for an outlet. We are
easily kindled in the direction of our instincts, as an
adolescent youth by the sight of a pretty girl, or of our
habits, as an archæologist by the discovery of a new kind
of burial urn.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is in this way, apparently, that all initiation or variation
takes place. It is never produced out of nothing;
there is always an antecedent system of tendencies, some
of which expand and fructify under fresh suggestions.
Initiation is nothing other than an especially productive
kind of working, one that proves to be the starting-point
for a significant development. A man of genius is one
in whom, owing to some happy combination of character
and situation, old ideas are kindled into new meaning
and power. All inventions occur through the mating of
traditional knowledge with fecundating conditions. A
new type of institution such as our modern democracy,
is but the expansion, in a propitious epoch, of impulses
that have been awaiting such an epoch for thousands of
years.</p>

<p class='c013'>But let us confess that we have no wisdom to explain
these motions in detail or to predict just when and how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>they will take place. They are deep-rooted, organic,
obscure, and can be anticipated only by an imagination
that shares their impulse. There is no prospect, in my
opinion, of reducing them to computation. The statement,
“that grows which works,” is true and illuminating,
but reveals more questions than it solves. Perhaps this
is the main use of it, that it leads us on to inquire more
searchingly what the social process actually is. It has,
I think, an advantage over “adaptation,” “selection,” or
“survival of the fittest” in that it gives a little more penetrating
statement of what immediately takes place, and
also in that it is not so likely to let us rest in mechanical
or biological conceptions.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER II<br> <span class='c011'>ORGANIZATION</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>ADAPTATION IS AN ORGANIZING PROCESS—UNCONSCIOUS ORGANIZATION
IN PERSONS—IMPERSONAL ORGANISMS—ORGANIC GROWTH
MAY BE OPPOSED TO THE WILL OF THE PERSONS INVOLVED—IN
WHAT SENSE SOCIETY IS AN ORGANISM—ORGANISM AND FREEDOM</p>

<p class='c010'>A process of adaptive “working” such as I have described
is a process also of organization, because it tends
to bring about a system of co-ordinated activities fitted
to the conditions, and that is what organization is. If a
theory, for example, is making its way into the minds of
men, and at each point where it is questioned or tested
arguments and experiments are being devised to support
it, then it is in course of organization. It is becoming
an intricate whole of related parts which work in the general
mind and extend its influence. The theory of evolution
has its organs in every department of thought, the
doctrine of eugenics, for example, being one form in which
it functions.</p>

<p class='c013'>The same is true of any living whole. Whenever a
person enters upon a new course of life his mind begins
to organize with reference to it; he develops ways of
thinking and acting that are necessary or convenient in
order that he may meet the new conditions. In this way
each of us grows to fit his job, acquiring habits that are
in some way congruous with it. A farmer, a teacher, a
factory worker, a banker, is certain to have in some respects
an occupational system of thinking. So a group,
if it is lasting and important, like a state, or a church, or
a political party, develops an organization every part of
which has arisen by adaptive growth.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>A university, if we look at it from this point of view,
appears as a theatre of multiform selective organization.
The students, already sifted by preparatory schools and
entrance examinations, are subject to further selection
for membership in the various academic groups. They
must pass certain preliminary courses, or attain a certain
standing before they can take advanced courses or be
admitted to honor societies. The athletic, dramatic, and
debating groups have also selective methods whose function
is to maintain their organized activities. And the
university as a whole, and especially its various technical
departments, acts as an agent of selection for society at
large, determining in great part who are fit for the different
professions. It is also a centre for the organization
of ideas. Intellectual suggestions relating to every
branch of knowledge, brought from every part of the
world by books and periodicals as well as by the cosmopolitan
body of teachers and students, are compared,
discussed, augmented, worked over, and thus organized,
presumably for the service of mankind.</p>

<p class='c010'>This organization, of which we are a part, like the
process that creates it, is more largely unconscious than
we are apt to perceive. We see human activities co-operating
ingeniously to achieve a common object, and
it is natural to suppose that this co-operation must be
the result of a plan: it is the kind of thing that may be
done by prevision, and it does not readily occur to us
that it can be done in any other way. But of course
organization is something far more extended than consciousness,
since plants, for example, exhibit it in great
intricacy. Indeed one of the main tasks of Darwin was
to overcome by a great array of facts the idea, accepted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>by his contemporaries, that the curious and subtle adaptations
of animal and vegetable life must be due to the
action of a planning intelligence. He showed that although
even more curious and subtle than had been perceived,
they might probably be explained by the slow
working of unconscious adaptation, without any plan
at all. No one deliberately set out to color the small
birds like the ground so that the hawk would not see
them, but by the production of birds of varying colors,
and the survival and propagation of those that had in
some degree a protective resemblance, the latter was
gradually perfected and established. The same principle
of unintentional adaptation is at work in human
life, and we need to be reminded of it because the place
of the will at the centre of our personal consciousness
leads us to exaggerate the sphere of its activity. The social
processes, though they result in a structure which
seems rational, perhaps, when it is perceived, are for the
most part not planned at all. Consciousness is at work
in them, but seldom consciousness of anything more than
some immediate object, some detail that contributes to
the whole without the actor being aware of the fact.
Generally speaking, social organisms feel their way without
explicit consciousness of where they want to go or
how they are to get there, even though to the eye of an
observer after the fact their proceedings may have an
appearance of rational prevision.</p>

<p class='c013'>This is true in a large measure even of persons, though
less true of them than of the more impersonal wholes.
We are seldom conscious of our personal growth in any
large way; we meet details and decide as best we can,
but the general flow of our time, our country, our class,
our temperament, carries us along without our being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>definitely aware of it. It is hardly possible for us to know
what is taking place in us until it is already accomplished:
contemporary history, in an individual as in a nation,
eludes our comprehension. A country girl finds work in
a city office, and presently discovers that she has taken
on the hurry and excitement of the town and cannot do
without it; a student enters college and at the end of
the year finds himself a different man, without having
intended it, or knowing how it came about. We take one
rather than another of the paths opening before us: they
do not seem to diverge much, but one leads around to
the west and another to the east. We do not know
what choices are important and what are not. In only
a few matters do we think out a policy, and in much fewer
do we carry it out. As Emerson said, there is less purpose
in the careers of successful men than we ascribe to
them; and one could soon fill a note-book with testimony
that the man and his work often find each other by mere
chance. A man is hungry and plans how to get a dinner,
in love and schemes to get a wife, desires power and racks
his brain for ways to get it; but it can hardly be said that
our intelligence is often directed to the rational organization
of our character as a whole. With some men it is,
certainly, but even they often find that they have failed
to understand their own tendency. Martin Luther declared
that “No good work comes about by our own
wisdom; it begins in dire necessity. I was forced into
mine; but had I known then what I know now, ten wild
horses would not have drawn me into it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Although we are a part of the growth of impersonal
forms of life we seldom know anything about it until it
is well in the past. We do not know when—for obscure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>reasons that even the psychologist can hardly detect—we
use one word rather than another, or use an old word
in a new sense, that we are participating in the growth of
the language organism. And yet this organism is vast,
complex, logical, a marvel, apparently, of constructive
ingenuity. It is the same with tradition and custom.
We never tell a story or repeat an act precisely as we heard
or saw it; everything is unconsciously modified by passing
through us and the social medium of which we are
a part, and these modifications build logical structures
which human intelligence, in the course of time, may or
may not discover. The students of folk-lore and primitive
culture deal chiefly with such material. The working or
vitality of one element of a tradition over another consists
in some power to stimulate impulses in the human mind,
which is, therefore, a selective agent in the process, but
we are no more aware of what is going on, usually, than
we are of the selective action of our digestive organs.
The folkways and <em>mores</em> which Professor Sumner has so
amply discussed are almost wholly of this nature.</p>

<p class='c013'>The commercialism of our time offers a modern instance.
Nobody, I suppose, has intended it: it has come upon us
through the mechanical inventions, the opening of new
countries and other conditions which have stimulated
industry and commerce, these in turn imposing themselves
upon the minds and habits of men at the expense of other
interests. An epoch, like an individual, has its somewhat
special functions, and a mind somewhat subdued to what
it works in. Such a development as that of the Italian
painting of the Renaissance, or of a particular school, like
the Venetian, is a real organism, fascinating to study in
the interactions and sequences of its activity, waxing
and waning under the spur of immediate influences without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>thought of the living whole which history now discovers.</p>

<p class='c013'>A city is a different sort of organism whose development
is, for the most part, equally unconscious. A frontier
settlement, we will say, is fortunately situated with
reference to the growth of the country, its water-power,
its port facilities, or something of the sort making it a
functional point. The settlers may or may not perceive
and co-operate with this advantage, but in any case the
town grows; trade and manufactures increase, railroads
seek it, immigration pours in, street-railways are laid, the
different elements segregate in different localities, and
we presently have a complex, co-ordinated structure and
life which, however faulty from the point of view of the
civic reformer, is a real organism, full of individuality and
interest. Think of Chicago or New Orleans, not to speak
of the riper development of London, Venice, or Rome.
Here are social organisms with only gleams of general
consciousness, growing by tentative selection and synthesis.
The case is much the same with nations, with
the Roman Empire, Spain, and Britain.</p>

<p class='c013'>Any one who follows the large movements of history
must perceive, I think, that he is dealing mainly with
unconscious systems and processes. At a given time
there is a social situation that is also a mental situation,
an intricate organization of thought. The growth of this
involves problems which the mind of the time is bound
to work out, but which it can know or meet only as details.
Thus the history of the Christian Church in the
Middle Ages presents itself to the student as the progressive
struggle, interaction, and organization not only of
specifically Christian ideas and traditions, but of all the
ideas and traditions of the time working upon each other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>in this central institution. Whatever beliefs men came
to were the outcome of the whole previous history of
thought. Vast forces were contending and combining in
an organic movement which we can even now but dimly
understand, and which the men involved in it could no
more see than a fish can see the course of the river.</p>

<p class='c013'>Feeling has an organic social growth which is, perhaps,
still less likely than that of thought to be conscious.
The human mind is capable of innumerable types and
degrees of sentiment, and the question what type shall
be developed or how far it shall be carried depends upon
social incitement. If certain ways of feeling become
traditional and are fostered by customs, symbols, and the
cult of examples, they may rise to a high level in many
individuals. In this way sentiment, even passion, may
have an institutional character. Of this too the various
phases of mediæval Christianity afford examples. Its
emotions were slowly evolved out of Roman, oriental, and
barbarian, as well as Christian, sources.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is notable that not only may the growth of a movement
be unintended by the persons involved in it, but it
may even be opposed to their wills. The oncoming of a
commercial panic, with the growing apprehension and
mistrust which almost every one would arrest if he could,
is a familiar example. The mental or nervous epidemics
which sometimes run through orphan asylums and similar
institutions are of somewhat the same nature. They
propagate themselves by their power to stimulate a certain
kind of nerve action and live in the human organism
without its consent.</p>

<p class='c013'>Indeed, are not all kinds of social degeneration—vice,
crime, misery, sensualism, pessimism—organic growths
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>which we do not intend or desire, and which are usually
combated by at least a part of those afflicted?</p>

<p class='c010'>There has been much discussion regarding the use of
such words as “organic,” “organization,” and “organism”
with reference to society, the last appearing specially
objectionable to some persons, who feel that it suggests
a closer resemblance to animal or plant life than does
in fact exist. On the other hand, “organism” seems in
many cases a fitter word than “organization,” which is
usually understood to imply conscious purpose. It matters
little, however, what term we use if only we have a
clear perception of the facts we are trying to describe.
Let us, then, consider shortly what we mean by such expressions.</p>

<p class='c013'>If we take society to include the whole of human life,
this may truly be said to be organic, in the sense that influences
may be and are transmitted from one part to
any other part, so that all parts are bound together into
an interdependent whole. We are all one life, and its
various phases—Asia, Europe, and America; democracy,
militarism, and socialism; state, church, and commerce;
cities, villages, and families; and so on to the particular
persons, Tom, Dick, and Harry—may all be regarded,
without the slightest strain upon the facts, as organs of
this whole, growing and functioning under particular
conditions, according to the adaptive process already discussed.
The total life being unified by interaction, each
phase of it must be and is, in some degree, an expression
of the whole system. My thought and action, for example,
is by no means uninfluenced by what is going on in
Russia, and may truly be said to be a special expression
of the general thought of the time.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>But within this great whole, and part of it, are innumerable
special systems of interaction, more or less distinct,
more or less enduring, more or less conscious and intelligent.
Nations, institutions, doctrines, parties, persons,
are examples; but the whole number of systems, especially
of those that are transient or indefinite, is beyond calculation.
Every time I exchange glances with a man on the
street a little process of special interaction and growth is
set up, which may cease when we part or may be indefinitely
continued in our thought. The more distinct and
permanent wholes, like nations, institutions, and ruling
ideas, attract peculiar study, but the less conspicuous
forms are equally vital in their way. As to persons, they
interest us more than all the rest, mainly because our
consciousness has a bias in their favor. That is, having
for its main function the guidance of persons, it is more
vivid and choosing with reference to the personal phase
of life than to any other. We know life primarily as
persons, and extend our knowledge to other forms with
some difficulty.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another notable thing about this strange complex is
the overlapping and interpenetration of the various forms,
so that each part of the whole belongs to more than one
organic system—somewhat as in one of those picture-puzzles
where the same lines form part of several faces,
which you must discover if you can. Thus one’s own
personality is one organic system; the persons he knows
are others, and from one point of view all human life is
made up of such personal systems, which, however,
will be found on close inspection not to be separate but
to interpenetrate one another. I mean that each personality
includes ideas and feelings reflected from others.
From another point of view the whole thing breaks up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>into groups rather than persons—into families, communities,
parties, races, states. Each has a history and life
of its own, and they also overlap one another. A third
standpoint shows us the same whole as a complex of
thoughts or thought-systems, whose <em>locus</em>, certainly, is
the human mind, but which have a life and growth of
their own that cannot be understood except by studying
them as distinct phenomena. All are equally real and
all are aspects of a common whole.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps the first requisite in the making of a sociologist
is that he learn to see things habitually in this way.</p>

<p class='c013'>If, then, we say that society is an organism, we mean,
I suppose, that it is a complex of forms or processes each
of which is living and growing by interaction with the
others, the whole being so unified that what takes place
in one part affects all the rest. It is a vast tissue of reciprocal
activity, differentiated into innumerable systems,
some of them quite distinct, others not readily traceable,
and all interwoven to such a degree that you see different
systems according to the point of view you take.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>It is not the case, as many suppose, that there is anything
in the idea of organism necessarily opposed to the
idea of freedom. The question of freedom or unfreedom
is rather one of the <em>kind</em> of organism or of organic process,
whether it is mechanical and predetermined, or creative
and inscrutable. There may be an organic freedom,
which exists in the whole as well as in the parts, is a total
as well as a particular phenomenon. It may be of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>very nature of life and found in all the forms of life.
Darwin seems to have believed in something of this kind,
as indicated by his unwillingness to regard the dinosaur
as lacking in free will.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c014'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The organic view of freedom agrees with experience and
common sense in teaching that liberty can exist in the
individual only as he is part of a whole which is also free,
that it is false to regard him as separate from or antithetical
to the larger unity. In other words the notion
of an opposition between organism and freedom is a
phase of the “individualistic” philosophy which regarded
social unity as artificial and restrictive.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER III<br> <span class='c011'>CYCLES</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>THE CYCLICAL CHARACTER OF SOCIAL PROCESS—THE CYCLES ORGANIC,
NOT MECHANICAL—THE GROWTH AND DECAY OF NATIONS—DOES
HISTORY REPEAT ITSELF?</p>

<p class='c010'>It is a familiar observation that there is a cyclical
character in all the movements of history. Every form
of organization has its growth, its vicissitudes, and
sooner or later, probably, its decline and disappearance.
The mob assembles and disperses, fashions come in and
go out, business prosperity rises, flourishes, and gives way
to depression, the Roman Empire, after centuries of
greatness, declines and falls.</p>

<p class='c013'>This is a trait of life in general, and the explanation
does not pertain especially to sociology. Still, if we assume
that social process is made up of functional forms
or organisms working onward by a tentative method, we
can see that their history is naturally cyclical. Any particular
form represents an experiment, conscious or otherwise,
and is never absolutely successful but has constantly
to be modified in order to meet better the conditions
under which it functions. If it does this successfully
it grows, but even in the growing it usually becomes more
complex and systematic and hence more difficult to change
as regards its general type. In the course of time the type
itself is likely to lose its fitness to the conditions, and so
the whole structure crumbles and is resolved into elements
from which new structures are nourished. The parties,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>the doctrines, the institutions of the past are for the most
part as dead as the men.</p>

<p class='c013'>Where institutions, like Christianity, have survived
for a millennium or two, it is commonly not their organization
that has endured, but a very general idea or sentiment
which has vitalized successive systems, each of which
has had its cycle of prosperity and decay.</p>

<p class='c010'>It does not follow that a social cycle is in any way
mechanical or predetermined, any more than it follows
that the individual life is so because each of us sooner
or later declines and dies.</p>

<p class='c013'>The word “rhythm” which has been used in this connection
by Herbert Spencer and others is questionable as
implying a mechanical character that does not exist.
When we are told that a movement is rhythmical we generally
infer, I think, that certain phases recur at stated
times, and can be predicted on this basis, like the ebb
and flow of tides.</p>

<p class='c013'>But if this is what the word means then the idea of
rhythm in the social process appears to be a fiction. I
doubt if any examples of it can be given, except such as
are immediately dependent upon some external phenomenon,
like our going to bed at night, or else are artificially
established, such as the cessation of work every seventh
day, or the celebration of the Fourth of July.</p>

<p class='c013'>The course of the fashions, or of the periods of prosperity
and depression in business, are fair examples of the
kind of phenomena supposed to be rhythmical; but it
does not appear, upon examination, that these movements
are mechanical or can be predicted by simple rules
of any sort. Can any one foretell the fashions more than
two or three months ahead, or by any method save that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>of inquiring what has already got a start in London or
Paris? Studies of their genesis show that even the most
expert are unable to tell in advance what designs will
“take.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Many have the impression that business cycles follow
a regular course, which can be plotted beforehand on
curves, and some, I believe, put sufficient faith in such
curves to invest their money accordingly, but I doubt if
they are especially successful. My impression is that the
few men who succeed in speculation do not trust to any
law of rhythm, but make an intensive study of the actual
state of the market, guiding themselves somewhat by
past records, but not forgetting that the present condition
is, after all, unique, and must be understood by a
special intellectual synthesis. I take it that those who
trust to mechanical formulas are much in the same class
as those who expect to get rich at Monte Carlo by the use
of an arithmetical “system.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A scientific study of business cycles, such as that carried
out with large scope and exhaustive detail by Professor
Wesley C. Mitchell, shows that they are complex
organic movements, belonging to a common general type—as
indicated by successive periods of confidence and
depression, of high and low prices, and so on—but differing
greatly from one another, altering fundamentally
with the development of business methods, and showing
no such pendulum-like regularity in time as is often supposed.
“The notion that crises have a regular period of
recurrence,” it seems, “is plainly mistaken.” “These
cycles differ widely in duration, in intensity, in the relative
prominence of their various phenomena, and in the
sequence of their phases.”<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c014'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Professor Mitchell’s work is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>an excellent example of what a scientific study of social
process, in the economic sphere, should be, and of the
uses and limits of the statistical method.</p>

<p class='c010'>The same sort of objection holds good against the idea
that social organisms of any sort, and more especially
nations, are subject to a <em>definite</em> law of growth and decay,
which enables us to predict their fate in advance. No
doubt they must all “have their closes” sooner or later,
but the process is complex and in part within the sphere
of will, so that there is no exact way of predicting how it
will work out. So far as nations have decayed in the past
it has been because their systems became too rigid for
change, or took on a form which demoralized the people,
or proved unable to resist conquest, or in some other way
failed to work effectually. These dangers are difficult
to avoid, and it is not surprising that most nations have
succumbed to them, but sound institutions intelligently
adapted to change might avert them indefinitely. It may
even be said that there are nations which have lived
throughout historical time. The Jews, for example, have
kept their national consciousness and their fundamental
ideas. Some modern nations, as France and England,
have endured many centuries and show no lack of
vigor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Predictions based on a supposed law of this nature are
constantly proving false. At almost any time during
the last three centuries English writers could be found
likening the condition of their country to that of imperial
Rome, and predicting a similar downfall; and recently
America has been threatened with a like fate. Many
have judged France and Spain to be hopelessly on the
downward path, and have elaborated theories of the causes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>of their decay, which have proved somewhat supererogatory.</p>

<p class='c013'>My own impression is that the freer and more intelligent
forms of national life arising under modern conditions
are likely, when well established, to have a much
longer life than older forms, the reason being that they
are plastic and capable of rational adaptation. There
will be ups and downs, but the actual dissolution of a self-conscious
modern nation is hard to conceive.</p>

<p class='c010'>The idea that history repeats itself is similar to that of
social rhythm. Certain principles of human nature and
social process operate throughout history, and their working
may be traced in one age as in another. Thus when
one nation is believed to be trying to dominate others it
is human nature that the latter should combine against
it; and in this sense it may be said that the Entente of
1914 was a repetition of the league against Napoleon.
But such resemblances are accompanied by essential differences,
so that the situation as a whole is new, and you
cannot predict the course of events except on the basis
of a fresh synthesis. It is easy to discover resemblances,
and to overestimate their importance.</p>

<p class='c013'>I take it that life as a whole is not a series of futile
repetitions, but an eternal growth, an onward and upward
development, if you please, involving the continual transformation
or elimination of details. Just as humanity
lives on while individuals perish, so the social organization
endures while particular forms of it pass away.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IV<br> <span class='c011'>CONFLICT AND CO-OPERATION</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>LIFE AS CONFLICT—CONFLICT AND ORGANIC GROWTH—CONFLICT
INSTIGATES CO-OPERATION—ORGANIZATION MAKES THE CONDITIONS
OF CONFLICT—THE TWO AS AN ORGANIC WHOLE—CONFLICT
AND WASTE—CONFLICT AND PROGRESS</p>

<p class='c010'>From the perennial discussion regarding the meaning
of conflict in life two facts clearly emerge: first, that conflict
is inevitable, and, second, that it is capable of a progress
under which more humane, rational, and co-operative
forms supplant those which are less so. We are born to
struggle as the sparks fly upward, but not necessarily to
brutality and waste.</p>

<p class='c013'><i><span lang="la">Vivere militare est</span></i>; even the gentlest spirits have felt
that life is an eternal strife. Jesus came to bring not
peace but a sword, and the Christian life has always been
likened to that of a soldier.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sure I must fight if I would reign,</div>
      <div class='line'>Increase my courage, Lord!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The thing is to fight a <em>good</em> fight, one that leaves life
better than it found it. In the individual and in the
race as a whole there is an onward spirit that from birth
to the grave is ever working against opposition. A cloud
of disease germs surrounds us which we beat off only by
the superior vigor of our own blood-corpuscles, and to
which as our organism weakens in age we inevitably succumb.
It is much the same in the psychological sphere.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Every meeting with men is, in one way or another, a demand
on our energy, a form of conflict, and when we are
weakened and nervous we cannot withstand the eyes of
mankind but seek to avoid them by seclusion.</p>

<p class='c013'>The love that pervades life, if it is affirmative and productive,
works itself out through struggle, and the best
marriage is a kind of strife. The sexes are as naturally
antagonistic as they are complementary, and it is precisely
in their conflict that a passionate intimacy is found.
We require opposition to awaken and direct our faculties,
and can hardly exert ourselves without it. “What we
agree with leaves us inactive,” said Goethe, “but contradiction
makes us productive.” Stanley, the explorer
of Africa, writes: “When a man returns home and finds
for the moment nothing to struggle against, the vast resolve
which has sustained him through a long and difficult
enterprise dies away, burning as it sinks in the
heart; and thus the greatest successes are often accompanied
by a peculiar melancholy.”<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c014'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>It is apparent that both conflict and co-operation have
their places in our process of organic growth. As forces
become organized they co-operate, but it is through a
selective method, involving conflict, that this is brought
about. Such a method compares the available forces, develops
the ones most fitted to the situation, and compels
others to seek functions where, presumably, they can
serve the organism better. There seems to be no other
way for life to move ahead. And a good kind of co-operation
is never static, but a <em>modus vivendi</em> under which we
go on to new sorts of opposition and growth. People may
be said to agree in order that their conflict may be more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>intimate and fruitful, otherwise there is no life in the
relation.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c014'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The two are easily seen to be inseparable in every-day
practice. When, for example, people have come together
to promote social improvement, the first thing to do is to
elect officers. This may not involve a conflict, but the
principle is there, and the more earnestness there is, the
more likelihood of opposition. Then there must be a discussion
of principles and programme, with occasional
ballots to see which view has won. I remember reading
of several rather serious conflicts within societies for the
promotion of peace, and churches and philanthropic
movements are not at all lacking in such incidents.</p>

<p class='c010'>Co-operation within a whole is usually brought about
by some conflict of the whole with outside forces. Just
as the individual is compelled to self-control by the fact
that he cannot win his way in life unless he can make his
energies work harmoniously, so in a group of any sort,
from a football-team to an empire, success demands coordination.
The boys on the playground learn not only
that they must strive vigorously with their fellows for
their places on the team, but also that as soon as their
team meets another this kind of conflict must yield to a
common service of the whole. In no way do working
people get more discipline in fellowship and co-operation
than in carrying through a strike. The more intelligent
students recognize some measure of conflict between
capital and labor as functional and probably lasting.
Like the struggle of political parties it is a normal process,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>through which issues are defined and institutions
developed.</p>

<p class='c013'>And likewise with nations. Their enlargement and
consolidation, throughout history, including the remarkable
development of internal organization and external
co-operation due to the great war, have almost invariably
been occasioned by the requirements of conflict. And if
we are to have a lasting world-federation it must preserve,
while controlling, the principle of national struggle.</p>

<p class='c010'>A factor of co-operation, of organization, always presides
over conflict and fixes its conditions. There is never
a state of utter chaos but always a situation which is the
outcome of the organic development of the past, and to
this the contestants of the hour must adjust themselves
in order to succeed. That this is the case when the
situation includes definite rules, as in athletic contests,
is manifest. But the control of the social organization
over conflict goes far beyond such rules, operating even
more through a general situation in which certain modes
of conflict are conducive to success and others are not.
In business the customary practices and opinions must be
observed as carefully as the laws, if one would not find
every man’s hand against him, and the same is true in
sports, in professional careers, in manual trades, in every
sphere whatsoever.</p>

<p class='c013'>Even in war, which is the nearest approach to anarchy
that we have on any large scale, it is not the case that a
presiding order is wholly absent. Any nation which defies
the rooted sentiment of mankind as to what is fair
in this form of conflict, regarding no law but that of force,
sets in operation against itself currents of distrust and resentment
that in the long run will overbear any temporary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>gain. The most truculent states so far understand this
that they try to give their aggressions the appearance
of justice.</p>

<p class='c010'>The more one thinks of it the more he will see that
conflict and co-operation are not separable things, but
phases of one process which always involves something of
both. Life, seen largely, is an onward struggle in which
now one of these phases and now another may be more
conspicuous, but from which neither can be absent.</p>

<p class='c013'>You can resolve the social order into a great number
of co-operative wholes of various sorts, each of which includes
conflicting elements within itself upon which it is
imposing some sort of harmony with a view to conflict
with other wholes. Thus the mind of a man is full of
wrangling impulses, but his struggle with the world requires
that he act as a unit. A labor-union is made up
of competing and disputing members; but they must
manage to agree when it comes to a struggle with the employer.
And employer and employees, whatever their
struggles, must and do combine into a whole for the
competition of their plant against others. The competing
plants, however, unite through boards of trade or similar
bodies to further the interests of their city against those
of other cities. And so the political factions of a nation
may be at the height of conflict, but if they are loyal they
unite at once when war breaks out with another country.</p>

<p class='c013'>And war itself is not all conflict, but often generates a
mutual interest and respect, a “sympathy of concussion.”
A scholar who perished in the trenches of the German
army in France wrote: “Precisely when one has to face
suffering as I do, it is then a bond of union enlaces me
with those who are over there—on the other side....
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>If I get out of this—but I have little hope—my dearest
duty will be to plunge into the study of what those who
have been our enemies think.” It is not impossible to
think of the battling nations as struggling onward toward
some common end which they cannot see. They slay
one another, but they put a common faith and loyalty
into the conflict; and out of the latter may come a
clearer view of the common right. It is a moral experiment
to which each contributes and defends its own
hypothesis, and if the righteous cause wins, or the righteous
elements in each cause, all will profit by the result.
So it was with the American Civil War, as we all feel now.
North and South say: “We differed as to what was right.
It had to be fought out. There might have been another
way if our minds had been otherwise, but as it was the
way to unity lay through blood.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Much has been said, from time to time, about our age
being one of combination, in the economic world at least,
and of the decline of competition. It would be more exact
to say that both combination and competition have been
taking on new forms, but without any general change in
the relation between them. What happens, for example,
when a trust is formed to unite heretofore competing
plants, is that unification takes place along a new line for
the purpose of aiding certain interests in their conflict
for aggrandizement. It is merely a new alignment of
forces, and has no tendency toward a general decline of
competition. Indeed every such trust not only fights outside
competitors, but deliberately fosters manifold competition
within its system, for the sake of exciting exertion
and efficiency. The different plants are still played off
one against the other, as are also the different departments,
the different foremen in each department, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>different workmen. By an elaborate system of accounting,
every man and every group is led to measure its
work against that of other men and other groups, and to
struggle for superiority. And the great combinations
themselves have not been and will not be left at peace.
If they absorb all their competitors they will have to
deal with the state, which can never permit any form of
power to go unchecked.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is evident that the vigor of the struggle is proportionate
to the human energy that goes into it, and that
we cannot expect tranquillity. It does not follow, however,
that the amount of conflict is a measure of progress.
The function of struggle is to work out new forms of co-operation,
and if it does not achieve this but goes on in a
blind and aimless way after the time for readjustment
has arrived, it becomes mere waste. Synthesis also takes
energy, and very commonly a higher or more rational
form of energy than conflict. Critics of the present state
of things are wrong when they condemn competition altogether,
but they are right in condemning many present
forms of it. Extravagant and fallacious advertising,
price-cutting conflicts, the exploitation of children and
squandering of natural resources, not to mention wars,
indicate a failure of the higher constructive functions.
Indeed the irrational continuance of such methods exhausts
the energies that should put an end to them, just
as dissipation exhausts a man’s power of resistance, so
that the more he indulges himself the less able he is to
stop.</p>

<p class='c010'>Evidently progress is to be looked for not in the suppression
of conflict but in bringing it under rational control.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>To do this calls for some sort of a social constitution,
formal or informal, covering the sphere of struggle, a
whole that is greater than the conflicting elements and
capable of imposing regulation upon them. This regulation
must be based on principles broad enough to
provide for pacific change and adaptation, to meet new
conditions. So far as we can achieve this we may expect
that struggle will rise to higher forms, war giving
place to judicial procedure, a selfish struggle for existence
to emulation in service, a wasteful and disorderly competition
to one that is rational and efficient. Our past development
has been in this direction, and we may hope
to continue it.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the current of events is ever bringing to pass unforeseen
changes, and if these are great and sudden they
may again throw us into a disorderly struggle, just as a
panic in a theatre may convert an assemblage of polite
and considerate people into a ruthless mob. Something
of this kind has taken place in connection with the industrial
revolution, bringing on a confusion and demoralization
from which we have only partly emerged. Another
case is where a conflict, for whose orderly conduct
the organization does not provide, having long developed
beneath the surface in the shape of antagonistic
ideals and institutions, breaks out disastrously at last,
as did the Civil War in the United States, or the great
war in Europe. We can provide against this only in the
measure that we foresee and control the process in which
we live. If we can do this we may look for an era of
deliberate and assured progress, in which conflict is confined
and utilized like fire under the boiler.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER V<br> <span class='c011'>PARTICULARISM <em>VERSUS</em> THE ORGANIC VIEW</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>INTELLECTUAL PARTICULARISM—ITS FALLACY—ECONOMIC DETERMINISM—THE
ORGANIC VIEW AS AFFECTING METHODS OF
STUDY—WHY PARTICULARISM IS COMMON</p>

<p class='c010'>We meet in social discussion a way of thinking opposed
to the conception of organic process as I have tried to
expound it, which I will call intellectual particularism.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c014'><sup>[7]</sup></a>
It consists in holding some one phase of the process to
be the source of all the others, so that they may be treated
as subsidiary to it.</p>

<p class='c013'>A form of particularism that until recently was quite
general is one that regards the personal wills of individual
men, supplemented, perhaps, by the similar will of a personal
God, as the originative factor in life from which
all else comes. Everything took place, it was assumed,
because some one willed it so, and for the will there was
no explanation or antecedent history: it was the beginning,
the creative act. When this view prevailed there
could be no science of human affairs, because there was
no notion of system or continuity in them; life was kept
going by a series of arbitrary impulses. As opposed to
this we have the organic idea that will is as much effect
as cause, that it always has a history, and is no more
than one phase of a great whole.</p>

<p class='c013'>In contrast to particularistic views of this sort we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>have others which find the originative impulse in external
conditions of life, such as climate, soil, flora, and fauna;
and regard intellectual and social activities merely as the
result of the physiological needs of men seeking gratification
under these conditions.</p>

<p class='c013'>A doctrine of the latter character having wide acceptance
at the present time is “economic determinism,”
which looks upon the production of wealth and the competition
for it as the process of which everything else is
the result. The teaching of Marxian socialism upon this
point is well known, and some economists who are not
socialists nevertheless hold that all important social questions
grow out of the economic struggle, and that all social
institutions, including those of education, art, and religion,
should be judged according as they contribute to
success in this struggle. This is, indeed, a view natural
to economists, who are accustomed to look at life from
this window, though most of them have enough larger
philosophy to avoid any extreme form of it.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c014'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The fallacy of all such ideas lies in supposing that life
is built up from some one point, instead of being an organic
whole which is developing as a whole now and, so
far as we know, always has done so in the past. Nothing
is fixed or independent, everything is plastic and takes
influence as well as gives it. No factor of life can exist
for men except as it is merged in the organic system and
becomes an effect as much as a cause of the total development.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>If you insist that there is a centre from which
the influence comes, all flowing in one direction, you fly
in the face of fact. What observation shows is a universal
interaction, in which no factor appears antecedent to
the rest.</p>

<p class='c013'>Any particularistic explanation of things, I should say,
must be based on the idea that most institutions, most
phases of life, are passive, receive force but do not impart
it, are mere constructions and not transitive processes.
But where will you find such passive institutions or
phases? Are not all alive, all factors in the course of
history as we know it? It seems to me that if you think
concretely, in terms of experience, such an explanation
cannot be definitely conceived.</p>

<p class='c013'>I hold that the organic view is not a merely abstract
theory about the nature of life and of society, but is concrete
and verifiable, giving a more adequate general description
than other theories of what we actually see, and
appealing to fact as the test of its value. It does not
attempt to say how things began, but claims that their
actual working, in the present and in the historical past,
corresponds to the organic conception.</p>

<p class='c013'>Let any one fix his mind upon some one factor or group
of factors which may appear at first to be original, and
see if, upon reflection, it does not prove to be an outgrowth
of the organic whole of history. Thus many start
their explanation of modern life with the industrial revolution
in England. But what made the industrial revolution?
Was it brought into the world by an act of
special creation, or was it a natural sequence of the preceding
political, social, intellectual, and industrial development?
Evidently the latter: it is a historical fact, like
another, to be explained as the outcome of a total process,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>just as much an effect of the mental and social conditions
of the past as it came to be a cause of those of the
future. I think this will always prove to be the case
when we inquire into the antecedents of any factor in
life. There <em>is</em> no beginning; we know nothing about beginnings;
there is always continuity with the past, and
not with any one element only of the past, but with the
whole interacting organism of man.</p>

<p class='c013'>If universal interaction is a fact, it follows that social
life is a whole which can be understood only by studying
its total working, not by fixing attention upon one activity
and attempting to infer the rest. The latter method
implies an idea similar to that of special creation, an idea
that there is a starting-place, a break of continuity, a
cause that is not also an effect.</p>

<p class='c010'>Such visible and tangible things as climate, fuel, soils,
fruits, grains, wild or domestic animals, and the like have
for many a more substantial appearance than ideas or
institutions, and they are disposed to lean upon these, or
upon some human activity immediately connected with
them, as a solid support for their philosophy of life. But
after all such things exist <em>for us</em> only as they have interacted
with our traditional organism of life and become a
part of it. Climate, as it actually touches us, may be
said to be a social institution, of which clothes, shelter,
artificial heat, and irrigation are obvious aspects. And
so with our economic “environment.” What are deposits
of iron and coal, or fertility of soil, or navigable waters,
or plants and animals capable of domestication, except
in conjunction with the traditional arts and customs
through which these are utilized? To a people with one
inheritance of ideas a coal-field means nothing at all, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>a people with another it means a special development of
industry. Such conditions owe their importance, like
anything else, to the way they work in with the process
already going on.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another reason for the popularity of material or economic
determinism is the industrial character of our time
and of many of our more urgent problems, which has
caused our minds to be preoccupied with this class of
ideas. A society like ours produces such theories just
as a militarist society produces theories that make war
the dominating process.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is easy to show that the “<em>mores</em> of maintenance,”
the way a people gets its living, exercise an immense influence
upon all their ideas and institutions.<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c014'><sup>[9]</sup></a> But what
are the “<em>mores</em> of maintenance”? Surely not something
external to their history and imposed upon them by their
material surroundings, as seems often to be assumed in
this connection, but simply their whole mental and social
organism, functioning for self-support through its interaction
with these surroundings. They are as much the
effect as they can possibly be the cause of psychical
phenomena, and to argue economic determinism from
their importance begs the whole question. Material factors
are essential in the organic whole of life, but certainly
no more so than the spiritual factors, the ideas, and institutions
of the group.</p>

<p class='c013'>Professor W. G. Sumner, probably by way of protest
against a merely ideal view of history, said: “We have
not made America; America has made us.” Evidently
we might turn this around, and it would be just as plausible.
“We” have made of America something very different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>from what the American Indians made of it, or
from what the Spaniards would probably have made of
it if it had fallen to them. “America” (the United States)
is the total outcome of all the complex spiritual and material
factors—the former chiefly derived from European
sources—which have gone into its development.</p>

<p class='c013'>To treat the human mind as the primary factor in life,
gradually unfolding its innate tendencies under the
moulding power of conditions, is no less and no more
plausible than to begin with the material. Why should
originative impulse be ascribed to things rather than to
mind? I see no warrant in observed fact for giving
preference to either.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c014'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>It is the aim of the organic view to “see life whole,”
or at least as largely as our limitations permit. However,
it by no means discredits the study of society from
particular standpoints, such as the economic, the political,
the military, the religious. This is profitable because the
whole is so vast that to get any grasp of it we need to
approach it now from one point of view, now from another,
fixing our attention upon each phase in turn, and then
synthetizing it all as best we can.</p>

<p class='c013'>Moreover, every phenomenon stands in more immediate
relation to some parts of the process than to others,
making it necessary that these parts should be especially
studied in order to understand this phenomenon. Hence
it may be quite legitimate, with reference to a given problem,
to regard certain factors as of peculiar importance.
I would not deny that poverty, for example, is to be
considered chiefly in connection with the economic system;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>while I regard the attempt to explain literature,
art, or religion mainly from this standpoint as fantastic.
But when we are seeking a large view we should
endeavor to embrace the whole process. No study of a
special chain of causes is more than an incident in that
perception of a reciprocating whole which I take to be
our great aim.</p>

<p class='c013'>If we think in this way we shall approach the comprehension
of a period of history, or of any social situation,
very much as we approach a work of organic art, like a
Gothic cathedral. We view the cathedral from many
points, and at our leisure, now the front and now the
apse, now taking in the whole from a distance, now lingering
near at hand over the details, living with it, if we
can, for months, until gradually there arises a conception
of it which is confined to no one aspect, but is, so far as
the limits of our mind permit, the image of the whole in
all its unity and richness.</p>

<p class='c013'>We must distinguish between the real particularist,
who will not allow that any other view but his own is
tenable, and the specialist, who merely develops a distinctive
line of thought without imagining that it is all-sufficing.
The latter is a man you can work with, while
the former tries to rule the rest of us off the field. Of
course he does not succeed, and the invariable outcome
is that men tire of him and retain only such special illumination
as his ardor may have cast; so that he contributes
his bit much like the specialist. Still, it would
diminish the chagrin that awaits him, and the confusion
of his disciples, if he would recognize that the life process
is an evolving whole of mutually interacting parts, any
one of which is effect as well as cause.</p>

<p class='c013'>It should be the outcome of the organic view that we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>embrace specialty with ardor, and yet recognize that it
is partial and tentative, needing from time to time to be
reabsorbed and reborn of the whole. The Babel of conflicting
particularisms resembles the condition of religious
doctrine a century ago, when every one took it for granted
that there could be but one true form of belief, and there
were dozens of antagonistic systems claiming to be this
form. The organic conception, in any sphere, requires
that we pursue our differences in the sense of a larger
unity.</p>

<p class='c013'>I take it that what the particularist mainly needs is a
philosophy and general culture which shall enable him to
see his own point of view in something like its true relation
to the whole of thought. It is hard to believe, for
example, that an economist who also reads Plato or
Emerson comprehendingly could adhere to economic
determinism.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are several rather evident reasons for the prevalence
of particularism. One is the convenience of a fixed
starting-point for thinking. Our minds find it much
easier to move by a lineal method, in one-two-three order,
than to take in action and reaction, operating at many
points, in a single view. In fact, it is necessary to begin
somewhere, and when we have begun somewhere we soon
come to feel that that <em>is</em> the beginning, for everybody,
and not merely an arbitrary selection of our own.</p>

<p class='c013'>Very like this is what I may call the <em>illusion of centrality</em>,
the fact that if you are familiar with any one factor of
life it presents itself to you as a centre from which influence
radiates in all directions, somewhat in the same way
that the trees in an orchard will appear to radiate from
any point where you happen to stand. Indeed it really
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>is such a centre; the illusion arises from not seeing that
every other factor is a centre also. The individual is a
very real and active thing, but so is the group or general
tendency; it is true that you can see life from the standpoint
of imitation (several writers have centred upon
this) but so you can from the standpoint of competition
or organization. The economic process is as vital as anything
can be, and there is nothing in life that does not
change when it changes; but the same is true of the ideal
processes; geography is important, but not more so
than the technical institutions through which we react
upon it; and so on.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another root of particularism is the impulse of self-assertion.
After we have worked over an idea a while
we identify ourselves with it, and are impelled to make
it as big as possible—to ourselves as well as to others.
There are few books on sociology, or any other subject,
in which this influence does not appear at least as clearly
as anything which the author intended to express. It is
not possible or desirable to avoid these ambitions, but they
ought to be disciplined by a total view.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have little hope of converting hardened particularists
by argument; but it would seem that the spectacle of
other particularists maintaining by similar reasoning
views quite opposite to their own must, in time, have some
effect upon them.</p>

<p class='c012'>THE ADAPTATION OF PERSONS ORGANIZES SOCIETY—PERSONAL COMPETITION
INEVITABLE—NEED OF INTELLIGENT ADAPTATION—OPPORTUNITY;
WHAT IS IT?—EFFECT OF MODERN TENDENCIES
UPON OPPORTUNITY—THE PROLONGATION OF IMMATURITY—OPPORTUNITY
THROUGH EDUCATION—THE HUMAN BASIS—VOCATIONAL
SELECTION—OTHER ADAPTIVE AGENCIES</p>

<p class='c010'>The most evident differentiation in the process of
human life is that into persons, each of whom strives
forward in a direction related to but never quite parallel
with that of his neighbor. And this onward striving,
when we regard it largely, is seen to be an experimental
and selective process which is maintaining and developing
the social organization. Its general direction is continuous
with the past, our will to live and to express ourselves
being moulded from infancy by the system which is the
outcome of ages of development. We feel our way into
this system, and in so doing become candidates for some
one of the functions of society. There are generally other
candidates, and we have to struggle, to adapt ourselves,
to renounce and compromise, until we reach some kind
of a working adjustment with our fellows. The whole
may be regarded as a vast game, the aim of which is to
arouse and direct endeavor along lines of growth continuous
with the past. The rules of the game, its scale, and
the spirit in which it is played, change from year to year
and from age to age; but its underlying function remains.</p>

<p class='c013'>Society requires, in its very nature, a continuous reorganization
of persons: any statical condition, any fixed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>and lasting adjustment, is out of the question. One reason
for this is that with every period of about fifty years
there is a complete change in the active <em>personnel</em> of the
system; man by man one crew withdraws and a new one
has to be chosen and fitted to take its place. When we
reflect upon the number of social functions, the special
training required for each, and the need that this training
should be allied with natural aptitude, it is apparent that
the task is a vast one and the time short.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is not merely the death of persons or the decay of
their faculties that calls for reorganization, but also the
changes in the social system itself, to which persons must
adapt themselves—the new industrial methods, the migrations,
the transformation of ideas and practices in
every sphere of life. These do not conform to the decay
of individuals but often strike a man in the midst of his
career, compelling him to begin again and make a new
place for himself in the game—if he can.</p>

<p class='c010'>All this comparison and selection cannot be managed
without a large measure of competition, however it may
be mitigated. It would seem that there must always be
an element of conflict in our relation with others, as well
as one of mutual aid; the whole plan of life calls for it;
our very physiognomy reflects it, and love and strife sit
side by side upon the brow of man. The forms of opposition
change, but the amount of it, if not constant, is at
any rate subject to no general law of diminution.</p>

<p class='c010'>If we are to make the process of life rational there is
nothing which more requires our attention than the adaptive
organization of persons. At present it is, for the
most part, a matter of rather blind experimentation, unequal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>from the point of view of individuals, and inefficient
from that of society. The child does not know what his
part in life is, or how to find it out: he looks to us to
show him. But neither do we know: we say he must
work it out for himself. Meanwhile the problem is solved
badly, in great part, and to the detriment of all of us.
Moreover, since it becomes daily more difficult with the
growing complexity and specialization of life, the unconscious
methods upon which we have hitherto relied
are less and less adequate to meet it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The method, however we may improve it, must remain
experimental, involving comparison and selection as well
as co-operation. The only possible alternative, and that
only a partial one, would be a system of caste under which
the function of the son would be determined by that of
his father. If the social system were stationary, so that
the functions themselves did not change, this method
would insure order without conflict, after a fashion; but
I need not say that it would be an inefficient fashion and
an order contrary to the spirit of modern life. For us
the way plainly lies through the acceptance of the selective
method, and its scientific study and reconstruction.</p>

<p class='c010'>What the individual demands with reference to this
reorganizing process is opportunity; that is, such freedom
of conditions that he may find his natural place,
that he may serve society in the way for which his native
capacity and inclination, properly trained and measured
with those of others in fair competition, will fit him. In
so far as he can have this he can realize himself best,
and do most for the general good. It is the desirable
condition from both the personal and the public points
of view.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>But if we ask just how this freedom is to be had, we
find that there is no simple answer. It differs for every
person and for every phase of his growth, and is always
the outcome not of one or two circumstances, but of the
whole system in which he lives. We cannot fix upon
any particular point in a man’s history as the one at
which he is, once for all, given or denied opportunity.
He needs it all his life, and we may well demand that he
have it during his prenatal development as well as after
birth; or, going back still further, we may try, by controlling
propagation, to see that he has a good hereditary
capacity to start with.</p>

<p class='c013'>Supposing that we begin at birth, we may regard newborn
children as undeveloped organisms, each of which
has aptitudes more or less different from those of any
other. These differences of aptitude are the basis of the
future social differentiation, but we have no means of
knowing what they are. Opportunity, if it is to be at
all complete, must begin right away; it should consist,
apparently, in a continuous process, lasting from birth
to death, which shall awaken, encourage, and nourish the
individual in such a way as to enable his highest personal
and social development. The study of it means that our
whole society must be considered with a view to the
manner in which it aids or hinders this process.</p>

<p class='c010'>The trend of social development is such as to make
opportunity more and more a matter of intelligent provision,
less and less one which can take care of itself.
Recent history presents the growth of a complex, specialized
system, offering, as time goes on, more functions
and requiring more selection and preparation to perform
them rightly. I say “rightly” because many of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>may be and are performed, after a fashion, with very
little selection or preparation; but the full human and
social function of the individual normally requires a personal
development proportionate to the development of
the whole.</p>

<p class='c013'>Formerly a boy growing up on a farm, let us say, had
his social possibilities in plain sight: he could either continue
on the farm or apprentice himself to one of several
trades and professions in the neighboring town. Nowadays
a thousand careers are theoretically open to him,
but these are mostly out of sight, and there is no easy
way of finding out just what they are, whether they are
suitable to him, or how he may hope to attain them.
The whole situation calls for a knowledge and preparation
far beyond what can be expected of unaided intelligence.</p>

<p class='c013'>If we are really to have opportunity we must evidently
make a science of it, and apply this science to the actual
interworking of the individual with the social whole.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is a well-known principle of evolution that the
higher the animal in the scale of life the longer must be
the period of infancy. That is, the higher the mental
and social organism the longer it takes for the new individual
to grow to full membership in it. The human infant
has the longest period of helplessness because he has
most to learn.</p>

<p class='c013'>Following out this principle, the higher our form of
society becomes the more intelligence and responsibility
it requires of its members, and hence the longer must be
the formative period during which they are getting ready
to meet these requirements. A civil engineer, for example,
must master a far greater body of knowledge now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>than fifty years ago. It is true that specialized industry
offers many occupations which, though they contribute
to a complex whole, are in themselves very simple, such
as tending the automatic machinery by which screws
are made. But it cannot be regarded as a permanent
condition that intelligent labor should be employed at
work of this kind. Intelligence is greatly needed; there
is never enough of it; and to leave it unused is bad management.
“A man is worth most in the highest position
he can fill.” Mechanical work should be done by machines,
and will be so done more and more as men are
trained for something higher. The lack of such training
I take to be one of the main reasons why men are kept
at tasks which do not use their intelligence. And even
at such tasks they are rarely efficient unless they understand
the meaning of what they are doing, so that they
can fit it into the process as a whole. The man who
lacks comprehension and adaptability is of little use; and
it is precisely to gain these that preparation is required.</p>

<p class='c013'>Moreover, beyond the technical requirements, we have
the need that a man should be prepared for social function
of a larger sort, to make his way in the vast and
open field of modern life, to find his job, to care for his
family, to perform his duties as a citizen. That many
are plunged into the stress and confusion of life without
such a preparation is an evil of the same nature as when
recruits are sent into battle without previous instruction
and discipline. The process of learning in action will be
destructive.</p>

<p class='c010'>In early childhood, opportunity means all kinds of
healthy growth—physical, mental, moral, social. This,
no doubt, is best secured through a good family. But we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>cannot have good families without a good community,
and so it calls for general measures to create and maintain
standards of life. It seems a simple truth, but is
one which we disregard in practice, that “equality of opportunity”
cannot exist, or begin to exist, except as it
extends to little children, and that it cannot extend to
them except through a somewhat paternal, or maternal,
vigilance on the part of society.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our principal institution having opportunity for its
object is education, and accordingly this has an increasing
function arising from the increasing requirements that
life makes upon it. Where it does not perform this function
adequately we see the result in social failure and degeneration—armies
of stunted children, privilege thriving
upon the lack of freedom, the poor tending to become a
misery caste, the prevalence of apathy and inefficiency.</p>

<p class='c013'>Since opportunity is a different thing for every individual,
and requires that each have the right development
<em>for him</em>, it is clear that education should aim at a study
and unfolding of individuality, and that, in so far as we
have uniform and wholesale methods, not dealing understandingly
with the individual as such, we are going
wrong.</p>

<p class='c013'>I recall that an able woman who had been a teacher in
a state institution for delinquent girls said to me that
every such girl had a desire, perhaps latent, to <em>be</em> something,
to express an individuality, and that the recognition
of this was the basis of a better system of dealing
with them. This is only human nature, and one way of
stating nearly all our social troubles is to say that individuality
has not been properly understood and evoked,
has not had the right sort of opportunity. To find a response
in life, to discover that what is most inwardly <em>you</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>is wanted also in the world without, that you can serve
others in realizing yourself; this is what makes resolute
and self-respecting men and women of us, and what the
school ought unfailingly to afford. The people who drift
and sag are those who have never “found themselves.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When, after hearing and reading many discussions
about the conduct of schools, I ask myself what I should
feel was really essential if I were intrusting a child of my
own to a school, it seems to me that there are two indispensable
things: first, an intimate relation with a teacher
who can arouse and guide the child’s mental life, and,
second, a good group spirit among the children themselves,
in which he may share. The first meets the need we all
have in our formative years for a friend and confidant in
whom we also feel wisdom and authority; and I assume
that we are not to rely upon the child’s finding such at
home. The second, equal membership in a group of our
fellows, develops the democratic spirit of loyalty, service,
emulation, and discussion. These are the primary conditions
which the child as a human being requires for the
growth of his human nature; and if I could be sure of
them I should not be exacting about the curriculum,
conceiving the harm done by mistakes in this to be small
compared with that resulting from defect in the social
basis of the child’s life. And it is the latter, it seems
to me, which, because of its inward and spiritual character,
not to be ascertained or tested in any definite way,
we are most likely to overlook.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is apparent that our present methods are far too
uniform and impersonal, that we too commonly press the
child into a mould and know little about him except how
nearly he conforms to it. And no doubt a tendency to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>this will always exist, because it can be avoided only by
a liberal expenditure of attention, sympathy, and other
costly resources, to save which there is always a pressure
to fall back upon the mould. Opportunity cannot be
realized without the ungrudging expenditure of money
and spirit in the shape of devoted and well-equipped
teachers, working without strain.</p>

<p class='c013'>The study and evolution of the individual should be
both sympathetic and systematic. There is a movement,
which seems to be in the right direction, not only to have
more and better teachers, but to continue longer the relation
between the teacher and the particular child, so
that it may have a chance to ripen into friendship, instead
of being merely perfunctory. And, on the side of
system, a continuous record should be kept which should
accompany the child through the schools, preserving not
only marks but judgments of his character and ability,
and so helping both others and himself to understand
him; for I see no reason why the subject of such documents
should not have access to them.</p>

<p class='c013'>At present the school does not commonly act upon the
child as a whole dealing with a whole, but makes a series
of somewhat disconnected attempts upon those phases
of him which come into contact with the curriculum, the
latter, rather than the individual, being the heart of the
organization. In this respect education is hardly so
advanced as the best practice in charity, which keeps a
sympathetic history of each person, and of his family
and surroundings, making this the base of all efforts to
help him.</p>

<p class='c013'>One who gives some study to current theories and practice
in education might well conclude that we were in a
state of confusion, with little prospect of the emergence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>of order. He may discover, however, one thread which
all good teachers are trying to keep hold of, namely, that
of adapting the school more understandingly to the mind
and heart of the child. Indeed our way of escape from
the distraction of counsels probably lies in focussing
more sympathy and common sense upon the individual
boy or girl. This calls for more good teachers and more
confidence in them as against mechanism of any sort.</p>

<p class='c010'>The later years of school life need a gradual preparation
for definite social function, the aim being to discover what
line of service is most probably suited to one’s capacities
and inclinations, and to train him for it. This preparation
is itself a social process, and one into which we cannot
put too much intelligence, sympathy, and patience.
Parents and teachers can aid in it by interesting the child
in the choice of a career, offering suggestions and helping
him to learn about his own abilities and the opportunities
open to them. He must feel that the problem is his
and that no one else can work it out for him. Psychological
tests should be of considerable help, and will no
doubt become more and more penetrating and reliable.
I think, however, that methods of this sort can never be
more than ancillary to the process of “trying out,” of
gradual, progressive experimentation as to what one can
actually do. We must still feel our way into life, but by
doing this largely before we leave school, and in a more
intelligent way, we can prevent the rift between the
school and the world from being the alarming and often
fatal chasm it now is.</p>

<p class='c013'>Unless we can have real opportunity in the schools—through
study of the individual, training, culture, and vocational
guidance, we cannot well have it anywhere else.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>That is, if education does not solve at least half the
problem of selective adaptation there is little hope of
rightly solving the other half in later years. The absence
of suitable preparation makes competition unfair and
disorderly. A boy leaving school at sixteen, without
having learned his own capacities or received the training
they require, is in no case to compete intelligently. It is
a rare chance if he finds his right place in the immense
and complex system. For the most part he takes up whatever
work offers itself, too commonly a blind-alley occupation
which leads nowhere.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is even worse with girls, who, regarding their work
as temporary, commonly take little interest in it. Anna
Garlin Spencer, in her Woman’s Share in Social Culture,
describes the usual state of the working girl as untrained,
unambitious, shirking, and careless, and speaks of “the
positive injury to the work sense, the demoralization of
the faculty of true service, that her shallow and transitory
connection with outside trade occupation so often
gives.”<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c014'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Competition means freedom and opportunity only on
condition that the individual is rightly prepared to compete.
Otherwise it may mean waste, exploitation and
degeneracy, and this is what it does mean to a large part
of young men, and a larger part of girls and women.</p>

<p class='c010'>Rational adaptation should be in operation everywhere,
and not merely in the schools. Employment bureaus,
public and private, should afford trained and sympathetic
study of individuals and an honest effort to place them
where they belong. Vocational guidance bureaus will
without doubt be greatly extended in scope and efficiency,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>and private industries will give more attention not only
to the expert choice, placing, and promotion of their employees,
but also to affording them recreation, technical
instruction, and culture. As we come to see better what
opportunity means, public opinion and private conscience
will demand it in many forms now unthought of.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VII<br> <span class='c011'>SOME PHASES OF CULTURE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>CULTURE AND TRAINING—CULTURE STUDIES—A CORE OF PURPOSE—CULTURE
IN SERVICE—ALL SHOULD HAVE AN ALMA MATER—RURAL
CULTURE—SOCIAL AND SPIRITUAL CULTURE—VARIETY IN
CULTURE</p>

<p class='c010'>The idea of life as an organic whole affords an illuminating
view of the old question of practical training <em>versus</em>
culture, letting us see that these are departments, or
rather aspects, of the process by which the individual
grows to full membership in the social order. They correspond
to two aspects, of differentiation and of unity,
in that order itself. In one of these society presents
itself as an assemblage of special functions, such as
teaching, engineering, farming, and carpentry, for each
of which a special preparation is required. But in another
it appears a continuous and unified organism, with
rich and varied traditions, intricate co-operation, and a
wide interplay of thought and sentiment. Full participation
in this calls for a general and human, as well as a
special and technical, adaptation; a development of personality,
of the <em>socius</em>, to the measure of the general life.</p>

<p class='c013'>Under this view culture is growth to fuller membership
in the human organism; not a decoration or a refuge or
a mystical superiority, but the very blood of life, so practical
that its vigor is quite as good a measure as technical
efficiency of the power of the social whole. Indeed the
practice of regarding the technical and the cultural as
separate and opposite is unintelligent. They are complements
of each other, and either must share in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>other’s defect. A society of training without culture
would be a blind mechanism which could be created and
maintained only by an external force; while one of culture
without training would lack organs by which to live.
The real thing in education is the organic whole of personal
development, corresponding to the organic whole of
social life; and of this culture and training are aspects
which, far from being set against each other as hostile
principles, should be kept in close union.</p>

<p class='c010'>The process of culture, then, is one of enlarging membership
in life through the growth of personality and social
comprehension. This includes the academic idea of culture
as the fruit of liberal studies, such as literature, art,
and history, because we get our initiation into the greater
life largely through these studies. The tradition which
so long identified culture with classical studies rested
upon this foundation. From the revival of learning
until quite recent years it was felt that the literatures and
monuments of Greece and Rome were the chief vehicles
of the best the human spirit had attained (except, perhaps,
in religion, which was held to be a somewhat separate
province), and accordingly the study of the ancients was
an apprenticeship to the larger life, an initiation into the
spiritual organism. And whatever change has come as
regards the classics, it is still true that studies which, like
literature, history, philosophy, and the appreciation of
the arts, aim directly at opening to us our spiritual heritage,
have a central place in real culture.</p>

<p class='c013'>Culture must always mean, in part, that we rise above
the special atmosphere of our time and place to breathe
the large air of great traditions that move tranquilly
on the upper levels. One should not study contemporaries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>and competitors, said Goethe, but the great men
of antiquity, whose works have for centuries received
equal homage and consideration.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c014'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>So far as schools are concerned culture depends at least
as much upon the teacher as upon what purports to be
taught. That is, it profits more by the kindling of a
spirit than by the acquirement of formal knowledge.
“Instruction does much, but inspiration does everything.”
Any subject is a culture subject when it is imparted
through one who is living ardently in the great life
and knows how to pass the spark on. And on the other
hand it is too plain how technical and narrowing is the
routine teaching of literature, which widely operates to
disgust the student with books he might otherwise have
enjoyed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Indeed culture, in one view, is nothing other than the
power to enter into sympathy with enlarging personalities.
We get our start in this from face-to-face intercourse,
and are fortunate if we have companions who can
open out a wider vision of life. But if we are to carry it
far we need the more select and various society that is
accessible only through books, and it often happens that
for an eager mind leisure and a library are the essential
things. It seems to me a serious question whether the
present trend of our colleges to suppress idling by requiring
from the student a large quantity of tangible work is
not injurious to culture by crowding out spontaneity and
a browsing curiosity. Disciplinarians scoff at this, as
they always will at anything irregular, but some of us
know that to us the chief benefit of a college course was
not anything we learned from the curriculum, but the
mere leisure and opportunity and delay, and we cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>doubt that there are still students of the same kind.
How can a man <i><span lang="la">vacare Deo</span></i> if he does conscientiously the
“required reading” that his instructors try to force upon
him? I am inclined to think that the ingenuity of the
collegian is often well spent in thwarting these endeavors
and securing time to loaf in spite of the conspiracy against
it. We require too much and inspire too little.</p>

<p class='c010'>If we view culture as a phase of the healthy growth of
the mind, we may expect that it will be most real when
it is allied with serious occupation and endeavor, provided
these are spontaneous, rather than when remaining apart.
We travel to see the world; but one who stays at home
with a spirit-building task will see more of it than one
who travels without one. The reason is that hearty
human life and work bring us into intelligence of those
realities that are everywhere if we live deep enough to
find them. The surest way to know men is to have simple
and necessary relations with them—as of buyer and
seller, employer and workman, teacher and scholar. It
is not easy to know them when you have no real business
with them. Culture must be won by active participation
of some sort, by putting oneself into something—as
Goethe won his by taking up a dozen arts and sciences
in succession, and working at each as if he meant to make
a profession of it. Any specialty, if one takes it largely
enough, may be a gate to wide provinces of culture.
Thus the study of law, which is merely a technical discipline
to most students, Burke found to be “one of the
first and noblest of human sciences, a science which does
more to quicken and invigorate the understanding than
all the other kinds of learning put together.”<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c014'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Technical training in the schools would not prove hostile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>to a real culture if it were associated with leisure and
liberal studies, and if the training itself were given in a
large spirit which leads the mind out to embrace the whole
of which the specialty is a member. And certainly manual
arts are not deficient in this respect. I imagine that I
have derived considerable culture from the practice of
amateur carpentry and wood-carving; and I have no doubt
that any one who has cared for an occupation of this kind
will have a similar feeling. There is a whole department
of life, full of delight and venerable associations, to which
handicraft is the key.</p>

<p class='c013'>Indeed, nothing is more surely culture than any work
in the spirit of art. Since one is doing it for self-expression
he puts himself into it; he must also undergo discipline
in the mastery of technic, and he has the social
zest of imparting joy to others and being appreciated by
them. It is real and vital as mere learning under instruction
rarely is. And one who has practised an art,
though with small success, will have a sense of what art
is that the mere looker-on can never have.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is quite true, in my opinion, that household training
could be given to girls in such a way that they would get
more culture out of it than nine-tenths of them now do
from the perfunctory study of history, languages, and
music. It would only require teachers who could impart
a spirit of craftsmanship and a sense of human significance.
An almost universal trouble with both boys and girls in
the present state of society is that they are not given, in
connection with their work, enough of the general plan
and movement of life to get interested in that and in
their part in it. The general movement is too much for
them; they do not see any plan in it, and merely catch
on to it where they can, work with it when they have to,
and put their real interest into crude amusement. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>do not make it natural for the individual to identify
himself and his task with the whole. To do that would
be culture.</p>

<p class='c013'>Possibly the view that culture is not opposed to technical
studies may, under the present ascendancy of the
latter, tend practically to confirm the subordination of
culture; but I aim to state underlying principles, and it
seems to me that the right relation between the two is
not much forwarded by partisanship for either, but rather
by showing that they are complementary and suggesting
a line of co-operation. The actual hostility of technical
and professional schools to culture arises from their
usually exacting and narrow character, which crowds
everything liberal out.</p>

<p class='c013'>I may add in this connection that it is a great part of
culture to learn how to <em>do something well</em>, no matter what
it is, to have the discipline and insight that we get by
persistent endeavor, undergoing alternate success and
failure, observing how, with time, the unconscious processes
come to our aid, and so gaining at last some degree
of mastery; in short, by experiencing how things are
really done. Unfortunately many students slip through
a supposed liberal education without getting this experience;
and no wonder the colleges are discredited by their
subsequent performance. In these times when home life
has widely ceased to afford practical discipline it is peculiarly
important that schools should do so.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the enlargement of the spirit, which is culture, calls
for something more than studies, of any kind. It needs
also a hearty participation in some sort of a common life.
The merging of himself in the willing service of a greater
whole raises man to the higher function of human nature.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>We need to aim at this in all phases of our life, but
nowhere is it easier to attain or more fruitful of results
than in connection with the schools. Since the school
environment is comparatively easy to control, here is
the place to create an ideal formative group, or system
of groups, which shall envelop the individual and mould
his growth, a model society by assimilation to which he
may become fit to leaven the rest of life. Here if anywhere
we can insure his learning loyalty, discipline, service,
personal address, and democratic co-operation, all by
willing practice in the fellowship of his contemporaries.
As a good family is an ideal world in miniature, in respect
of love and brotherhood, so the school and playground
should supply such a world in respect of self-discipline
and social organization. There is nothing now
taking place, it would seem, more promising of great results
than the development of groups which appeal to the
young on the social and active side of their natures and
evoke a community spirit. They take eagerly to such
groups, under sympathetic leadership, finding self-expression
in them, and there seems to be no great obstacle
to their becoming universal and embracing all the
youth of the land in a wholesome <em>esprit de corps</em> which
would be a hundred times more real and potent with
them than any kind of moral instruction. The motive
force is already there, in the natural idealism of boyhood
and adolescence; all we need to do, apparently, is to
provide the right channels for it. This is a field where
the harvest is plenteous, and which the laborers are only
beginning to discover.</p>

<p class='c010'>All of us who have been at college know something of
the spiritual value of an <em>alma mater</em>, of memories, associations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>and symbols to which we can recur for the revival
of fellowship and the ideals of youth. If we ever have
noble ideals it is when we are young, and if we keep them
it is apt to be by continuing early influences.</p>

<p class='c013'>It seems, then, that every one ought to have an <em>alma
mater</em>, that whatever kind of school one leaves to enter
the confusion and conflict of the world, it should be enshrined
within him by friendship, beauty, ceremony, and
high aims, and that these should be renewed by revisiting
the academic scene at occasional festivals. Our common
schools, in town and country, might thus play the part
in the life of the mass of the people that colleges do in
that of a privileged class, providing continuous groups
charged with a high social spirit, and capable of extending
this spirit indefinitely. There is nothing we need
more than continuity and organization of higher influence,
and hardly any way of achieving this so practicable
as through the schools.</p>

<p class='c010'>Each community should have a centre of social culture
connected with the public schools, and the character of
this would vary with that of the community. There is
especial need for building up in the country a type of culture
which is distinctively rural in character, and yet not
inferior to urban culture in its power to enlarge life.
Country life attracts the imagination by its comparative
repose, by the stability and dignity that one associates
with living on the land, and by its wholesome familiarity
with plant and animal life. But these attractions are
offset at present by social and spiritual limitations which
lead most of those who have a choice to prefer the towns.
If each district had a culture centre where the finer needs
of life might be gratified in as great a measure as anywhere,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>and yet with a rural flavor and individuality, the
country would be more a place to live in and less one to
flee from as soon as you can afford to do so. These
centres, we may hope, will grow up about the centralized
and enlarged schools that are now beginning to replace
the scattered one-room buildings, bringing better and
more various instruction, including studies especially appropriate
to rural life. Around the school might be
grouped the rural church; also consolidated, socialized,
and made a real centre of fellowship and co-operation;
the public library, art gallery, and hall for political and
social gatherings. In a community enjoying such institutions,
with a spirit and traditions of its own, life ought
to be at least as livable as in town.</p>

<p class='c010'>It will turn out, I believe, that the higher social culture
is of a kindred spirit with religion. The essence of religion,
I suppose, is the expansion of the soul into the
sense of a Greater Life; and the way to this is through
that social expansion which, however less in extent, is of
the same nature. One who has developed a spirit of
loyalty, service, and sacrifice toward a social group, has
only to transform this to a larger conception in order to
have a religious spirit. Indeed it is clear that the more
ardent kind of social devotion, like that of the patriot
for his country in extreme times, is hardly distinguishable
from devotion to God. His country, for the time being,
is the incarnation of God, and in some measure this is
true of any group which embodies his actual sense of a
greater life than that of his own more confined spirit. I
think, then, that social culture through devotion to the
service and ideals of an inspiring group is in the direction
of religious culture, and probably, for most minds, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>natural and healthy road to the latter. I do not mean
to suggest that school and community groups should
supplant the churches; but it seems to me that they may
supply a broad foundation upon which churches and
other organizations may set their more special structures.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shall we not come to teaching every one, by concrete
social experience, a community spirit that shall be the
basis at once of citizenship, of morals, and of religion?
Why should not the simple principles of democracy and
righteousness and worship be so humanized and popularized
in the life of the community and the school that the
children shall almost unconsciously learn and practise
them? Do we not need, in these matters, an alphabet
of a few letters to replace the Chinese writing of the past?</p>

<p class='c013'>I may add that if every man had a suitable task of his
own, for which he was properly trained, and could see
the relation of that task first to larger work of the same
sort and then to the general human life, it would build up
religious faith in a way not otherwise possible. Our work
is the most vital part of us, or should be, and if we can
see it as one with the ordered life of humanity, and divine
a connection with the Greater Life, we shall hardly lack
religion. Religion is, for one thing, the sense of a man’s
self as member of a worthy whole, and his sense of self
is formed by his striving. On the other hand, anarchy
of endeavor breaks up faith.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is perhaps unnecessary that we should agree upon
definitions and programmes of culture. Although it is
always some kind of enlargement of the spirit, it must
vary with individuals and communities. The higher
literary culture, calling for mastery of languages and long
immersion in the great traditions, is only for a few, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>yet it is essential for some kinds of leadership and should
always be open to those who show an aptitude for it.
The group culture in connection with the schools is of
great promise as affording a simple and genial way of
spiritual growth in which the least intellectual may share.
The study and practice of specialties is capable of indefinite
development on the culture side. In short, culture
is itself a complex organic process which ought to permeate
life, but can never be reduced to rules.</p>

<p class='c012'>EXISTENCE AND INFLUENCE OF CLASS—INHERITANCE CLASSES IN RELATION
TO THE FAMILY—HAS INHERITED PRIVILEGE A SOCIAL
VALUE?—HOW FAR INEQUALITIES OF WEALTH COULD BE PREVENTED
BY EQUAL OPPORTUNITY—ELIMINATION OF ORGANIZED
MISERY—EQUAL OPPORTUNITY A GOOD WORKING IDEAL—WHAT
KIND OF EQUALITY IS ATTAINABLE</p>

<p class='c010'>All societies are more or less stratified into classes,
based on differences in wealth, occupation, and enlightenment,
which tend to be passed on from parents to children;
and this stratification creates and perpetuates difference
in opportunity. No one needs to be told that
extreme poverty may mean ill-nurture in childhood—resulting
perhaps in permanent enfeeblement—impaired
school work, premature leaving of school, practical exclusion
from higher education, stunting labor in early
years followed by incapacity later, a restrictive and perhaps
degrading environment at all ages, and a hundred
other conditions destructive of free development. A
somewhat better economic situation may still involve
disadvantages which, though not so crushing, are sufficiently
serious as bars to higher function.</p>

<p class='c013'>Professor H. R. Seager, a careful economist, has suggested
that the population of the United States may be
roughly divided into five classes or strata, which are
largely non-competing, in the sense that individuals are
in great part shut off from opportunities in classes above
their own. The highest class, enjoying family incomes
of more than three thousand dollars a year, has the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>fullest opportunity. In the second class, with incomes
of from one thousand five hundred dollars to three thousand
dollars, the boys begin work at sixteen or seventeen
years, and are handicapped in starting by lack of resources
and outlook. They are too apt to choose work
which pays well at once, but does not lead to advancement,
and only a very small per cent rise above the condition
of their parents. A third class, with incomes of
from six hundred dollars to one thousand five hundred
dollars, is marked by early marriages, large families, early
withdrawal from school, and lack of outlook. Its members
are rarely able to compete for the better positions
with classes one and two. A fourth class, of wage-earners
at from one to two dollars a day (at the time the book
was published), shows the same conditions accentuated.
Their necessarily low standard of living and its mental
and social implications bar a rise in the world, and they
compete, as a rule, only for that grade of work to which
they are born. The fifth is a misery class, in which the
most destructive and degrading conditions prevail.<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c014'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>I am not sure that this analysis is not somewhat one-sided,
especially in allowing too little influence to the relaxing
effects of ease upon those born in the upper class,
but it is certainly nearer the truth than the optimistic
dogma that in this free country every one has an equal
chance.</p>

<p class='c013'>And lack of pecuniary resource is by no means the only
thing that restricts opportunity and confines one within
a class. To grow up where the schools are poor and the
neighborhood associations degrading, to belong to a despised
race, to come of an immigrant group not yet assimilated
to the language and customs of the country,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>or simply to have vicious or unwise parents, may prevent
healthy development irrespective of economic resources.<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c014'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The existence of inherited stratification is due to the
fact that the child is involved in the situation of the
family. As long as the latter surrounds him, determining
his economic support and social environment, there must
be a strong tendency for the condition of the parents to
be transmitted. And this merging of the child in the
family is in itself no evil, but arises naturally out of the
functions of the family as the group charged with the
nurture of the coming generation.</p>

<p class='c013'>In other words, there is a certain opposition between
the ideal of equal opportunity and that of family responsibility.
Responsibility involves autonomy, which will
produce divergence among families, which, in turn, will
mean divergent conditions for the children; that is, unequal
opportunities. We all recognize that individuals
will not remain equal if they are allowed any freedom;
and the same is true of families; even if they started with
the same opportunities they would make different uses
of them, and so create inequalities for the children. And
we might go further back, and say that so long as communities
and occupation-groups have any freedom and responsibility
there will be inequalities among them also,
in which families and children will be involved. A state
of absolute equality of opportunity is incompatible with
social freedom and differentiation.</p>

<p class='c013'>As society is now constituted, it recognizes the responsibility
of the family, in an economic sense at least, and
makes the desire to provide well for one’s children a chief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>inducement to industry, thrift, and virtue in general.
Unless we are prepared to change all this we must allow
a man to retain for his children any reasonable advantages
he may be able to win. It is only a question of what
advantages are reasonable.</p>

<p class='c013'>No one who thinks in full view of the facts will imagine
that anything like identity of opportunity is possible.
There must be diversities of environment, whether due
to family or to other conditions, and these will diversify
the opportunities of the children. Equality is only one
among several phases of a sound social ideal, and must
constantly submit to compromise. There is much to be
said for the view that we need to work toward more
definitely organized special environments and traditions,
because of the higher and finer achievement which these
make possible; and if we do, these can hardly fail to impress
a greater diversity upon those born into them.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is on this ground of the need of special environments
and traditions to foster the finer kind of achievement
that inherited privilege has been most plausibly defended.
Thus it is argued that the people who gain wealth and
power have, as a rule, ability above the average, and that
the inheritance of their wealth and position, and often
of their ability, makes possible the growth of a really
superior class, with high traditions and ideals, suitable
for leadership in politics, art, science, philanthropy, and
other high functions which do not offer a pecuniary reward.
Certainly we need such a class, and if this is the
way to get it no petty jealousy ought to hinder us. There
is no doubt that the upper classes of Europe have grown
up in this way, and have largely performed these higher
functions; and even in American democracy we owe
much of our finer leadership to inherited privilege.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>This will probably continue to be the case, and yet
there is no good reason why we should relax our endeavors
to make opportunity more equal. If, through these endeavors,
one kind of upper class becomes obsolete, we
may expect the rise of another, based on a freer principle.</p>

<p class='c013'>The finer kinds of training and ideals may be secured
otherwise than through inherited privilege; namely, by
having them organized in continuing groups and institutions
to which individuals are admitted not through privilege,
but freely, on the basis of proved capacity, the institutions
providing them with whatever income they
need for their function. In this way, for example, talented
men and women, without inherited advantage,
work their way to careers in art, science, and education,
supported by fellowships and salaries. The fact that an
occupation-group is not hereditary does not at all prevent
it from having an effective class spirit and tradition,
as we may see in the medical or engineering professions.
This is the method of open classes, the ideal one for a
modern society, and ought to be developed with the aim
of making all the higher kinds of service sufficiently paid,
and so capable of drawing the talent they need from
wherever it may be found.</p>

<p class='c013'>If the environment of a specially cultured family is at
present essential to the finest culture development, this
is perhaps because the general conditions of culture and
early opportunity are not at all what they might be.
When the misery class is abolished and a more discerning
education fosters talent in children from all classes,
the value of special privilege will be reduced.</p>

<p class='c010'>If opportunity were made as nearly equal as possible,
consistently with preserving the family, we might reasonably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>expect that the higher functions of society would be
better performed, because there would be a wider selection
of persons to perform them, and also that they would
be cheaper, because of the broader competition. Indeed
many hold that we might come to get the services of the
best lawyers, doctors, business men, and others whose
work requires elaborate training, at prices not much
above what are now paid for skilled manual labor.</p>

<p class='c013'>I think, however, that the latter expectation would be
disappointed, and that no conceivable equalization of opportunity
would prevent great differences in salaries and
other gains. Such differences would arise not only from
unlikeness in ability, but also from the incalculable nature
of the social process, which is sure to act differently upon
different persons and result in diverse fortunes.</p>

<p class='c013'>As regards the professions, even if the requisite education
were made accessible to all, successful practitioners
would still, probably, command large pay. A long technical
preparation, such as is necessary for law or surgery
or metallurgy, would still be a difficult and speculative
enterprise, involving foresight, resolution, and risk of
failure, and this barrier would make competent practitioners
comparatively scarce. One cannot be sure that
his abilities are of the right sort, and while many make
the venture who are not qualified to succeed, so, without
doubt, many who are qualified do not make it. It is
often a matter of mere luck whether a man discovers
what he is fit for or not, and it is not likely that vocational
guidance can altogether obviate this. The result is that
only a part of the potential competitors actually enter the
field, and in the case of the less settled professions this
is apt to be a very small part.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then such matters as the place where a man begins
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>to practise, and the connections he makes early in
his career, are largely fortuitous and have results beyond
his foresight. One course of circumstances may lead
him into a position where his services are indispensable
to a group of wealthy clients, while another may result
very differently. Men with an ill-paying practice are not
necessarily men of less ability than those who are getting
rich.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still less can we expect that exorbitant gains in business
could be obviated by any possible equality of opportunity.
In general such gains imply not only ability
but a fortunate conjunction of circumstances which could
not have been foreseen with any certainty when the man
was making his start. There is an element of luck and
speculation in the matter, the result of which is that of
a thousand who started with equal abilities and opportunities,
perhaps only one or two will be on hand at the
right place and time, and with the right equipment to
make the most of an opening. When it appears there is
commonly a small group of men in range of it who are
there rather by good fortune than foresight. Of these
the ablest, by endowment and training, will grasp it.</p>

<p class='c013'>So long as the movements of life are free and unanticipated
in anything like the present measure, the individual
will be like a swimmer upon the surface of a torrent,
able to make headway in this direction or that
according to his strength, but still very much at the mercy
of the stream. If he finds himself near a boat he may
reach it and climb aboard, but ninety-nine others who can
swim just as well may have all they can do to keep their
heads above water.</p>

<p class='c013'>This is fairly obvious in common observation. At a
gathering, which I was privileged to attend, of the principal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>men of a neighboring commercial city, it seemed
that the prevailing type was quite commonplace. They
appeared kindly and of a good business intelligence, but
hardly in such a degree as one might expect in the leading
men of a leading community. Apparently the city
had grown and these men attached, as it were, to the
growing branches, had been lifted up accordingly.</p>

<p class='c013'>I take it that large gains, and even gains that are unjust,
so far as individual merit is concerned, are inevitable,
though some of the more flagrant inequalities might
be reduced by social reform. We must, then, deal with
them after they are made, and this points to a policy of
drastic taxation, the revenue to be used for the common
welfare, and also to moral control of the use of wealth
through public opinion and social ideals.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is probably true that the poor, of a scattered and
sporadic sort, will always be with us; but organized poverty
might be abolished. I mean that the misery class,
now existing at the bottom of the economic scale and perpetuating
itself through lack of opportunity for the children,
might be eliminated through minimum standards
of family life and cognate social reforms. For those who,
for whatever reason, fall below the standards there should
be a special care designed to prevent their condition becoming
established in misery environments, and so passed
on to another generation. As it is now, lack of opportunity
perpetuates misery, which in turn prevents opportunity,
and so on in a vicious circle. The general result
is a state of social degeneracy through which ignorance,
vice, inefficiency, squalor, and lack of ambition are
reproduced in the children. Families not far above the
misery line also need special care to prevent their being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>crowded over it. While it seems likely that, in spite of
all our precautions, misery will continue to be generated,
we ought to be able to prevent its organization in a continuous
class.</p>

<p class='c013'>To do this we shall certainly have to proceed with the
delicate task of supplementing family responsibility without
essentially impairing it. We have already come far
in this direction, with our compulsory education, restrictions
on child labor, removal from parents of abused or
neglected children, probation officers, mothers’ pensions,
visiting nurses, medical inspection in the schools, and so
on. We need to do much more of the same sort, and the
question just how far we can go in a given direction without
doing more harm than good must be decided by experience.</p>

<p class='c010'>I think that equal opportunity, though not wholly
practicable, is one of our best working ideals. We are not
likely to go too far in this direction. There is a natural
current of privilege, arising from the tendency of advantages
to flow in the family line, and any feasible diversion
into broader channels will probably be beneficial. The
unfailing tendency of possessors to hold on to their possessions
and pass them to their children is guaranty
against excessive equalization.</p>

<p class='c010'>Although dead-level equality is neither possible nor
desirable, we may hope for equality in the sense that every
child may have the conditions of healthy development,
and a wide range of choice, including, if he has the ability,
some of the more intellectual occupations. There is
such a thing as a human equality—as distinguished from
one that is mechanical—which would consist in every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>one having, in one way or another, a suitable field of
growth and self-expression. This would be reconcilable
with great differences of environment and of wealth, but
not with ignorance or extreme poverty.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IX<br> <span class='c011'>THE THEORY OF SUCCESS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>A SOCIOLOGICAL VIEW OF SUCCESS—SUCCESS AND THE SOCIAL ORDER—INTELLIGENCE—AGGRESSIVE
TRAITS—SYMPATHETIC TRAITS—HANDICAPS—A
TEST OF ABILITY</p>

<p class='c010'>The question of success is a sociological question, in
one phase at least, because it concerns the relation of the
individual to the group, of the personal process to that of
society at large. It should be somewhat illuminating to
regard it from this point of view.</p>

<p class='c013'>What is success? To answer this rightly we must
unite the idea of personal self-realization with a just conception
of the relation of this to the larger human life.
Perhaps we shall not be far wrong if we say that success
is self-development in social service. It must be the
former, certainly, and if it is true that the higher forms
of the personal life are found only in social function, it
must be the latter also.</p>

<p class='c013'>This view well stands the test of ordinary experience.
It is self-development in social service that most surely,
gives the <em>feeling</em> of success, the fullest consciousness of
personal existence and efficacy. No matter what a man’s
external fortunes may be, how slender his purse or how
humble his position, if he feels that he is living his real
life, playing his full part in the general movement of the
human spirit, he will be conscious of success. The martyrs
who died rejoicing at the stake had this consciousness,
and so, at the present time, may soldiers have it
who perish in battle, and thousands of others, whose work,
if not so perilous, offers no prospect of material reward—missionaries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>social agitators, investigators, and artists.
It is not confined to any exceptional class but is found
throughout humanity. If a man is working zealously
at a task worthy in itself and not unsuited to his capacity,
he has commonly the feeling of success.</p>

<p class='c013'>Success of this sort meets another common-sense test
in that it usually gives the maximum influence over
others of which one is capable. People do not influence
us in proportion to their external power, but in proportion
to what we feel to be their intrinsic significance
for life; their ideals, their fidelity to them, their love,
courage, and hope. And one who gives himself heartily
to the highest service he feels competent to, will attain
his maximum significance.</p>

<p class='c010'>Success, then, is a matter of effective participation in
the social process; and to get a clearer idea of it we may
well consider further what the latter calls for. The organization
of society has two main aspects, that of unity
and that of differentiation, the aspect of specialized functions
and the aspect of a total life for which these functions
co-operate. The life of the individual, if it is to be one
with that of society, must share in these aspects, must
have a specialized development and at the same time a
unifying wholeness. He must be able, by endowment
and training, to do well some one kind of service, as carpentry,
let us say, or farming, or banking; and must also
have a breadth of personality which participates largely
in the general life and makes him a good citizen. The social
process is like a play in that no actor can do his own
part well except as he enters into the spirit of the whole:
he must be a true member, the organization needs to be
alive in every part. A nation is a poor thing unless the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>citizen is a patriot, entering intelligently into its spirit
and aims, and the principle applies in various manners
and degrees to a community, a shop, a school—any whole
in which one may share.</p>

<p class='c013'>If one thinks of the human process at large, with its
onward striving, its experimentation, its conflicts and co-operations,
its need for foresight and for unity of spirit;
and then asks what kind of an individual it takes to do
his full part in such a process, he will be on the track of
the secret of personal success. It calls for energy and
initiative, because these are the springs of the process;
self-reliance and tenacity, because these are required to
discover and develop one’s special function; sympathy
and adaptability, because they enable one to work his
function in with the movement as a whole. And intelligence
is needed everywhere, in order that his mind may
reflect and anticipate the process, and so share effectively
in it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whatever we are trying to do, we need a sound imagination
and judgment, and lack of these enters into nearly
all cases of inefficacy and failure. If a machinist, let us
say, understands as a whole the piece of work upon which
he is engaged, he can do his part intelligently, adaptively,
and with a sense of power; and in so far is a successful
man. He serves well and develops himself. If, beyond
this, he has the mind to grasp as a whole the work of some
department of the shop, so as to see how it ought to go,
if he has also the understanding of men, based on imagination,
which enables him to select and guide them; he is
fit to become a foreman. Similar powers of a larger
range make a competent superintendent. And so with
social functions in general, large or small. A good President
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>of the United States is, first of all, one who has the
constructive social imagination to grasp, in its main
features, the real situation of the country, the vital problems,
the significant ideas and men, the deep currents of
sentiment. Without this there can be no real leader of
the people. Likewise each of us has an ever-changing
social situation to deal with, and will succeed as he can
understand and co-operate with it.</p>

<p class='c013'>A good administrative mind is a place where the organization
of the world goes on. It is the centre of the
social process, where choices are made and men and
things assigned to their functions.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have found it a main difference among men, and one
not easy to discern until you have observed them for some
time, that some have a constructive mind and some have
not. One whom I think of has a remarkably keen and
independent intellect, and is not at all lacking in ambition
and self-assertion. Those who know him well have expected
that he would do remarkable things, and the
only reason why he has not, that I can see, is that his
ideas do not seem to undergo the unconscious gestation
and organization required to make them work. There
is something obscurely sterile about him. On the other
hand, I have known a good many young men, not particularly
promising, who have gradually forged ahead just
because their conceptions, though not brilliant, seemed
to have a certain native power of growth, like that of a
sound grain of corn. All life is an inscrutable and mainly
unconscious growth, and it is thus with that share of it
that belongs to each of us.</p>

<p class='c010'>Among the more aggressive traits that enter into success
I might specify courage, initiative, resolution, faith,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>and composure. These are required in undertaking and
carrying through the hazardous enterprises of which every
significant life must consist.</p>

<p class='c013'>Success will always depend much upon that explorative
energy which brings one into practical knowledge and into
contact with opportunity. The man of courage and initiative
is ever learning things about life that the passive
man never finds out. He learns, for example, that it is
almost as easy to do things on a great scale as on a small
one, that there are usually fewer competitors for big positions
than little ones, that few tasks are very difficult
after you have broken your way into them, that bold
and resolute spirits rule the world without unusual intellect,
and that the ablest men commonly depend upon
the quality rather than the quantity of their exertions.
Practical wisdom of this sort is gained mainly by audacious
experimentation.</p>

<p class='c013'>In general, life is an exploring expedition, a struggle
through the wilderness, in which each of us, if he is to
get anywhere, needs the qualities of Columbus or Henry
M. Stanley. He must make bold and shrewd plans, he
must throw himself confidently into the execution of them,
he must hang on doggedly in times of discouragement,
and yet he must learn by failure. We need all the opportunity
that society can give us, but it will do us little
good without our own personal force, intelligence, and
persistence.</p>

<p class='c013'>In our Anglo-Saxon tradition doggedness is a kind of
institution. There is a tacit understanding that the
right thing to do is to undertake something difficult and
venturesome, and then to hang on to it, with or without
encouragement, until the last breath of power is spent.
“So long as I live,” said Stanley, about to start on one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>his journeys across Africa, “something will be done;
and if I live long enough all will be done.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Traits like courage and initiative begin in a certain overflow
of energy, but they easily become habitual, like everything
else. If in one or two instances you overcome the
inertia and apprehension that keeps men stuck in their
tracks, and discover that God helps those who help themselves,
you soon learn to continue on the same principle.
Boldness is as easy as timidity, indeed much easier, as it
is easier for an army to attack, than successfully to retreat.
The militant attitude gives a habitual advantage.</p>

<p class='c013'>The higher kind of self-reliance is the same as faith;
faith in one’s intuitions, in life and the general trend of
things, in God. I am impressed by observation with the
fact that success depends much upon a living belief that
the world does move, with or without our help, and that
the one thing for us to do is to move with it and, if possible,
help it on. If one has this belief it is easy and exhilarating
to go ahead with the procession, while dull and
timid spirits think that life is stationary and that there is
no use trying to make it budge.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1856 Lincoln, who was endeavoring to arouse sentiment
against the extension of slavery, called a mass meeting
at Springfield, Illinois, to further his views; but only
three persons attended, himself, his partner Herndon, and
one John Pain. When it was evident that no more were
coming, Lincoln arose and after some jocose remarks on
the size of his audience, went on to say: “While all seems
dead, the age itself is not. It liveth as sure as our Maker
liveth. Under all this seeming want of life the world
does move, nevertheless. Be hopeful, and now let us
adjourn and appeal to the people.”<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c014'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Life is constantly developing and carrying us on in its
growth. We do not need to impel it so much as we sometimes
think. A main thing for us is to hang on to our
higher hopes and standards and have faith that the larger
life will supply our deficiencies. God is a builder; to be
something we must build with him; understanding the
plan if we can, but building in any case.</p>

<p class='c013'>Composure is partly a natural gift, but partly also an
acquired habit, enabling a man to exert himself to his
full capacity without worry and waste; to sleep soundly
by night after doing his utmost by day, like the Duke of
Wellington, who declared, “I don’t like lying awake;
it does no good, I make it a point never to lie awake,”
and who, if I remember correctly, took a nap while waiting
for the battle of Waterloo to begin. The commanding
positions of life are held by men of fighting capacity,
and this demands the ability to bear hard knocks, reverses
and uncertainty without too much disturbance. Richelieu
said that if a man had not more lead than quicksilver
in his composition he was of no use to the state.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is a certain antagonism between composure and
imagination, both of which are prime factors in success.
The latter tends to make one sensitive and apprehensive,
while the former requires that he take things easily and
cast out worry. The ideal would be to have a sensitive
imagination which could be turned off or on at will; but
this is hardly possible, though discipline and habit will
do wonders in toughening the spirit.</p>

<p class='c016'>we are assured by Emerson; but in fact there are many
who cannot learn to endure with equanimity the roughand-tumble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>of ordinary competition, and need, if possible,
to seclude themselves from it. This was apparently the
case with Darwin—who fell far short of Wellington’s
standard as to lying awake—and with a large part of the
men who have done creative work of a finer sort. Indeed
such work, if pursued incontinently, involves a mental
and nervous strain and a morbid sensibility which has
brought many choice spirits to ruin.</p>

<p class='c013'>The self-reliant and path making traits are more and
more necessary as society increases in freedom and complexity,
because this increase means an enlargement of
the field of choice and exploration within which the individual
has to find his way. Instead of restricting individuality,
as many imagine, civilization, so far as it is a
free civilization, works quite the other way. We may
apply to the modern citizen a good part of what Bernhardi
says of the individual soldier in modern war: “Almost
all the time he is in action he is left to himself. He
himself must estimate the distances, he himself must
judge the ground and use it, select his target and adjust
his sights; he must know whither to advance; what point
in the enemy’s position he is to reach; with unswerving
determination he himself must strive to get there.”<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c014'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The sympathetic traits supplement the more aggressive
by enabling one to move easily among his fellows and
gain their co-operation. Modern conditions are more
and more requiring that every man be a man of the world;
because they demand that he make himself at home in
an ever-enlarging social organism.</p>

<p class='c013'>I suppose that if one were coaching a young man for
success, no counsel would be more useful than this: “Approach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>every man in a friendly and cheerful spirit, trying
to understand his point of view. Such a spirit is contagious,
and if you have it people will commonly meet
you in the same vein. Do not forget your own aims,
but cultivate a belief that others are disposed to do them
justice.” We are too apt to waste energy in apprehensive
and resentful imaginations, which tend to create what
they depict. It is notable that the principle of Christian
conduct, namely, that of imagining yourself in the other
person’s place, is also a principle of practical success.</p>

<p class='c013'>The spirit of a man is the most practical thing in the
world. You cannot touch or define it; it is an intimate
mystery; yet it makes careers, builds up enterprises, and
draws salaries.</p>

<p class='c013'>Retiring people who work conscientiously at their task
but lack social enterprise and facility, often feel a certain
sense of injustice, I think, at the more rapid advancement
of those who have these traits but are, perhaps, not
so conscientious and well-grounded. A man of decidedly
good address and not wholly deficient in other respects
can secure profitable employment almost on sight, and be
rapidly promoted over men, otherwise fully equal to him,
who lack this trait. And there may, after all, be no injustice
in this, because the selection is based on a real
superiority in any work calling for influence over other
people. Perhaps the best refuge for the retiring man is
to reflect that character is a main factor in such influence,
and that if he has this and plucks up a little more courage
in asserting it, he may find that he has as much address
as others.</p>

<p class='c010'>I believe that the more external and obvious handicaps
to success are much less serious than is ordinarily supposed.
Such traits as deafness, lameness, bad eyesight,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>ugliness, stammering, extreme shyness, and the like, are
often detrimental only in so far as they are allowed to
confine or intimidate the spirit, and will seldom prevent a
courageous person from accomplishing what is otherwise
within his ability. They are by no means such fatal obstacles
to intercourse as they may appear. The very fact
that one has the heart to face the world on the open road
regardless of an obvious handicap may make him interesting,
so that while he may have to suffer an occasional
rebuff from the vulgar, the men of real significance will
be all the more apt to respect and attend to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>And the effect on his own character may well be to
define and concentrate it, and give it an energy and discipline
it would otherwise have lacked. Those apparently
fortunate people who have many facilities, to whom
every road seems open, are hardly to be envied; they
seldom go far in any direction. Except in some such
way as this, how can we explain the cases in which the
totally blind, for example, have succeeded in careers like
medicine, natural science, or statesmanship? I judge
that they do it not because of superhuman abilities, but
because they have the hardihood to act on the view that
the spirit of a man and not his organs is the essential
thing.</p>

<p class='c013'>The most harmful thing about handicaps, especially in
the children of well-to-do parents, is often the injudicious
commiseration and sheltering they are apt to induce.
This may well go so far as to deprive such children of
natural contact with reality and prevent their learning
betimes just what they have to contend with and how
to overcome it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The natural test of a man’s ability is to give him a
novel task and observe how he goes about it. If he is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>able he will commonly begin by getting all the information
within reach, reflecting upon it and making a plan.
It should be a bold plan, and yet not rash or impracticable,
though it may seem so; based in fact upon a
just view of the conditions, and especially of the personalities,
with which he has to deal. It will be, emphatically,
his own plan, and an able man will generally prefer to
keep it to himself, because he knows that he may have
to change it, and that discussion may raise obstacles.</p>

<p class='c013'>In carrying it out he will show a mixture of resolution
and adaptability; learning by experience, modifying his
plan in details, but in the main sticking to it even when
he does not clearly see his way, because he believes that
courage and persistence find good luck. He “plays the
game” to the end, and if he fails he has too strong a sense
of the experimental character of life to be much discouraged.</p>

STANDARDS—EFFECT OF A NON-CONFORMING RIGHTEOUSNESS—MIGHT

MIGHT AND RIGHT</p>

<p class='c010'>Apparently the minds of men have always been
troubled by the question whether it really does pay to be
righteous. One gets the impression from certain of the
Psalms and other passages in the Old Testament that
the Jews were constantly asking themselves and one another
this question, and that the psalmists and prophets
strove to reassure them by declaring that, though the
wicked might seem to prosper, they would certainly be
come up with in the long run. “Rest in the Lord and
wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him
who prospereth in his way, because of the man who
bringeth wicked devices to pass.”<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c014'><sup>[18]</sup></a> “I have seen the
wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green
bay tree, yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not; yea I
sought him but he could not be found.”<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c014'><sup>[19]</sup></a> “I have been
young and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous
forsaken nor his seed begging bread.”<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c014'><sup>[20]</sup></a> The question is
also mooted by Plato, in the Republic and elsewhere,
while Shakespeare, in his 66th Sonnet, mentions “captive
good attending captain ill” among the things which make
him cry for restful death. Even the Preacher says: “Be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>not righteous overmuch, why shouldst thou destroy thyself?”
<em>Is</em> honesty the best policy, and, if so, in just what
sense?</p>

<p class='c010'>I would answer that there is never a conflict between a
real or inner righteousness and a real or inner success;
they are much the same thing; but there may easily be
a conflict between either of them and an apparent or conventional
success. Conscious wrong-doing must always
be detrimental to a success measured by self-development
and social service. Its effect upon the wrong-doer himself
is to impair self-respect and force of character. He
divides and disintegrates himself, setting up a rebellion
in his own camp, whereas success calls for unity and discipline.
A man who is bad, in this inner sense, is in so
far a weak and distracted man. As Emerson remarks,
one who “stands united with his thought” has a large
opinion of himself, no matter what the world may think.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is also true that the sense of righteousness and integrity
gives him the maximum influence over others of
which he is capable, and so the greatest power to serve
society. If we are weak and false to our own conscience,
this cannot be hidden, and causes us to lose the trust and
co-operation of others. It is not at all necessary to this
that we should be found out in any specific misdeed; our
face and bearing sufficiently reveal what we are, and induce
a certain moral isolation, or at least impair our
significance and force. Character is judged by little
things, of which we ourselves are unaware, and rightly,
because it is in these that our habitual tendency is revealed.
They register our true spirit and mode of thinking,
which cannot be concealed though we are the best
actors in the world. If there is anything disingenuous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>about us, anything which will not bear the light, those
who consider us will feel its presence, even though they
do not know what it is.</p>

<p class='c013'>In so far as a man consciously does wrong he tears himself
from that social whole in which alone he can live and
thrive. In this way it is true that “The face of the Lord
is against them that do evil.”<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c014'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>I suppose that so long as it is kept on this high ground
few would deny the truth of the principle. Men generally
admit that spiritual significance is enhanced by moral
integrity. Some, however, would question whether it
has much application to success in a more ordinary and
perhaps superficial sense of the word, to the attainment
of wealth, position, and the like.</p>

<p class='c013'>But even here it is in great part sound. If we take the
ordinary man, whose moral conceptions do not differ
much from those of his associates, and place him in an
ordinary environment, where there is a fairly well-developed
moral sense according to the standards of the
group, it will be true that righteousness tends, on the
whole, to prosperity. The lack of it puts one at odds
with himself and his group in the manner already noted.
The unrighteous man is swimming against the current,
and though he may make headway for a while it is
pretty sure to overcome him in time. Men of experience
almost always assert, sincerely and truthfully, I
believe, that honesty and morality are favorable to success.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sceptic, however, is apt to say that though the
principle may be plausible in itself and edifying for the
graduating class of the high school, common experience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>shows that it does not work in real life; and he has no
difficulty in pointing to cases where success seems to be
gained in defiance of morality. It may be worth while,
therefore, to discuss some of these. I think they may be
brought under three classes: those in which success is
only apparent or temporary; those in which a wrong-doer
succeeds by uncommon ability, in spite of his wrong-doing;
and those which involve a lack or divergence of
group standards.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is always possible to gain an immediate advantage
by disregarding the rules that limit other people, but in
so doing one defies the deeper forces of life and sets the
mills of the gods at work grinding out his downfall. He
may cheat in fulfilling a contract or in a college examination,
but he does this at the expense of his own character
and standing. “Look at things as they are,” we read in
the Republic of Plato, “and you will see that the clever
unjust are in the case of runners, who run well from the
starting-place to the goal, but not back again from the
goal; they go off at a great pace, but in the end only
look foolish, slinking away with their ears down on their
shoulders, and without a crown; but the true runner
comes to the finish and receives the prize and is crowned.”
Montaigne held with Plato, and said: “I have seen in
my time a thousand men of supple and ambiguous natures,
and that no one doubted but they were more worldly-wise
than I, ruined where I have saved myself: <i><span lang="la">Risi
successu carere dolos</span></i>.”<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c014'><sup>[22]</sup></a> I recall being told by a man of
business experience that “sharpness” in a young man
was not a trait that promised substantial success, because
he was apt to rely upon it and fail to cultivate
more substantial qualities.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Saint Louis, who was the exemplar of all the virtues of
his age, enlarged his dominions, withstood aggression and
built up his administration all the more successfully for
his saintly character. “He was as good a king as he was
a man,” and his unique position as the first prince in
Europe “was due not so much to his authority and resources
as to the ascendancy won by his personal character
and virtues.”<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c014'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Apparently the world is full of injustice; men often get
and keep places to which they have no moral right, as
judged by the way they function; but the unconscious
forces inevitably set to work to correct the wrong, and as
a rule, and in due time, the apparent success is revealed
as failure. It is a wound against which the moral organism
gradually asserts its recuperative energy.</p>

<p class='c013'>Again, wrong-doing is often associated with uncommon
ability, which is the real cause of a success that would
probably be greater, certainly of a higher kind, if the man
were righteous. We cannot expect that a merely passive
morality—not to cheat, swear, steal, or the like—should
suffice for an active success. That requires positive qualities,
like energy, enterprise and tenacity, which are indeed
moral forces of the highest order, but may be associated
with dishonesty or licentiousness. We might easily offset
Saint Louis with a list of great men, more in the style
of Napoleon, whose personal behavior was not at all edifying.
Since life is a process, and the great thing is to
help it along, it is only just that active qualities should
succeed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Those cases of successful wrong-doing where a lack of
group standards is involved can be understood if we take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>account of the network of relations in which the man
lives. The view that success and morality go together
supposes that he is surrounded by fairly definite and uniform
standards of right kept alive by the interplay of
minds in a well-knit group. This is the only guarantee
that the individual will have a conscience or a self-respect
which will be hurt if he transgresses these standards, or
that the group will in any way punish him.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the state of things may be so anarchical that there
is no well-knit, standard-making group, either to form the
individual’s conscience or to punish his transgressions.
This will be more or less the case in any condition of social
transition and confusion, and is widely applicable to our
own time. If the economic system is disintegrated by
rapid changes, there will be a lack of clear sense of right
and wrong relating to it, and a lack of mechanism for enforcing
what sense there is: so that we need not be surprised
if piratical methods in business go unpunished, and
are practised by men otherwise of decent character. Beyond
this an enormous amount of immorality of all kinds,
in our time, may be ascribed to the unsettled condition
in which people live. They become moral stragglers, not
kept in line by the discipline of any intimate group.
This applies not only to those whose economic life shifts
from place to place, but also to those who have a stable
economic function, but, like many “travelling men,” lead
a shifting, irresponsible social life.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is often much the same with men of genius. The
very fact that they have original impulses which they
must assert against the indifference or hostility of the
world about them, compels them to a certain moral isolation,
and in hardening themselves against conformity
they lose also the wholesome sense of customary right and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>wrong. So they live in a kind of anarchy which may be
inseparable from their genius, but is detrimental to their
character, and more or less impairs their work.</p>

<p class='c013'>You may, if you please, pursue the same principle into
international relations and the political philosophy of
Machiavelli. Among nations bad faith and other conduct
regarded as immoral for individuals has flourished
because international public opinion has been faint and
without hands. This is more true of some epochs than
others, and was particularly the case among the small,
despotic and transitory states of Italy in the time of the
Renaissance. Machiavelli, I suppose, desiring above
all things the rise of a Prince who, by gaining supreme
power, should unite and pacify the country, laid down
for his guidance such rules of success—immoral if applied
to personal relations—as he believed were likely to
work in the midst of the moral anarchy which prevailed.
There is, however, no sound reason for erecting this opportunism
into a general principle and holding that international
relations are outside the moral sphere. They
come within that sphere so fast as single nations develop
continuity and depth of life, and nations as a group become
more intimate. Then moral sentiment becomes a
force which no nation can safely disregard.</p>

<p class='c010'>In many cases of what we judge to be bad conduct the
man belongs to a group whose standards are not the same
as those of our own group by which we judge him. If
his own group is with him his conscience and self-respect
will not suffer, nor will he, so far as this group is concerned,
undergo any blame or moral isolation. Practically
all historical judgments are subject to this principle. I
may believe that slaveholding was wrong; but it would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>be very naïve of me to suppose that slaveholders suffered
from a bad conscience, or found this practice any bar to
their success. On the contrary, as it is conventional
morality that makes for conventional success, it would
be the abolitionist who would suffer in a slaveholding
society. It is simply a question of the <em>mores</em>, which, as
Sumner so clearly showed, may make anything right or
anything wrong, so far as a particular group is concerned.</p>

<p class='c013'>The conflict of group standards within a larger society
is also a common example. The political grafter, the unscrupulous
man of business, the burglar, or the bad boy,
seldom stands alone in his delinquency, but is usually
associated with a group whose degenerate standards more
or less uphold him, and in which he may be so completely
immersed as not to feel the more general standards at all.
If so, we cannot expect his conscience will trouble or his
group restrain him. That must be done by the larger
society, inflicting blame or punishment, and especially,
if possible, breaking up the degenerate group. In many,
perhaps most, of such cases the mind of the individual is
divided; he is conscious of the degenerate standards and
also of those of the larger group; they contend for his
allegiance.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is no question of this kind more interesting than
that of the effect upon success of a higher or non-conforming
morality. What may one expect when he breaks
convention and strives to do better than the group that
surrounds him? Evidently his situation will in many
respects be like that of the wrong-doer; in fact he will
usually be a wrong-doer in the eyes of those about him,
who have no means of distinguishing a higher transgression
from a lower.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>In general this higher righteousness will contribute to
an intrinsic success, measured by character, self-respect,
and influence, but may be expected to involve some sacrifice
of conventional objects like wealth and position.
These generally imply conformity to the group that has
the power to grant them.</p>

<p class='c013'>The rewards of the first sort, if only a man has the resolution
to put his idea through, are beyond estimate—a
worthy kind of pride, a high sense of the reality and significance
of his life, the respect and appreciation of congenial
spirits, the conviction that he is serving man and
God. The bold and constant innovators—whatever their
external fortunes may be—are surely as happy a set of
men as there is, and we need waste no pity upon them
because they are now and then burned at the stake.</p>

<p class='c013'>The ability to put his idea through, however, depends
on his maintaining his faith and self-reliance in spite of
the immediate environment, which pours upon him a
constant stream of undermining suggestions, tending to
make him doubt the reality of his ideas or the practicability
of carrying them out. The danger is not so much
from assault, which often arouses a wholesome counteraction,
as from the indifference that is apt to benumb
him. Against these influences he may make head by
forming a more sympathetic environment through the
aid of friends, of books, of imaginary companions, of
anything which may help him to cherish the right kind
of thoughts. From the mass of people he may expect
only disfavor.</p>

<p class='c013'>The trouble with many of us is that, though we reject
the customary, we have not the resolution and the clearness
of mind to carry out our own ideals and accept the
consequences. We try to serve two masters. Conscious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>that we have deserved well of the world in striving for
the higher right, we are not quite content with the higher
sort of success appropriate to such a striving, but vaguely
feel that we ought to have external rewards too—which
is quite unreasonable. This falling between two stools is
a much more common cause of failure than excessive boldness.
To gain wealth or popularity is success for some,
and for them it is a proper aim; but the man of a finer
strain must be true to his finer ideal. For him to “decline
upon” these things is ruin.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir Thomas Browne remarks that “It is a most unjust
ambition to desire to engross the mercies of the Almighty”
by demanding the goods of body and fortune when we
already have those of mind, and goes on to say that God
often deals with us like those parents who give most of
their material support to their weak or defective children,
and leave those that are strong to look out for themselves.<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c014'><sup>[24]</sup></a>
Ordinary success—wealth, power, or standing
coming as the prompt reward of endeavor—is, after all,
for second-rate men, those who do a little better than
others the jobs offered by the ruling institutions. The
notably wise, good, or original are in some measure protestants
against these institutions, and must expect their
antagonism. The higher success always has been and
always must be attained at more or less sacrifice of the
lower. The blood of the martyrs is still the seed of the
church.</p>

<p class='c013'>We ought to be prepared for sacrifice; and yet in these
more tolerant times there may be less need for it than we
anticipate, and many a young man who has set out prepared
to renounce the world for an ideal has found that
he was not so much ahead of his time as he thought.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Sometimes he has gained more honor and salary than was
good for him, and has ended in a moral relaxation and decline.
I think that even if one were advising a young
man with a view to worldly success alone, and it were a
question between conformity and a bold pursuit of ideals,
the latter would usually be the course to recommend,
since the gain in character and intrinsic power in following
it would more than offset, in most cases, the advantage
of conventional approval. Ministers who offend churches
by modern views, politicians who refuse to propitiate the
corrupt element, business men who will not make the
usual compromises with honesty, are as likely as not to
profit by their course, though they should be prepared
for the opposite. That which appeals to the individual
as a higher right seldom appeals to him alone, but is likely
to be obscurely working in others also, and on the line
of growth for the group as a whole, which may therefore
respond to his initiative and make him a leader.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perhaps this same principle may illuminate the general
question of Might <em>versus</em> Right in the social process. We
mean by might, I suppose, some established and tangible
form of power, like military force, wealth, office, or the
like; while right is that which is approved by conscience,
perhaps in defiance of all these things. It would seem
at first as if these two ought to coincide, that the good
should also be the strong.</p>

<p class='c013'>But if we accept the idea that life is progress, it is easy
to see that no such coincidence is to be expected. If we
are moving onward and upward by the formation of higher
ideals and the struggle to attain them, then our conscience
will always be going out from and discrediting the actual
forms of power. Whatever is will be wrong, at least to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>the aspiring moral sense. We have, then, between might
and right, a relation like that between the mature man
and the child, one strong in present force and achievement,
the other in promise. Right appeals to our conscience
somewhat as the child does, precisely because it is not
might, but needs our championship and protection in
order that it may live and grow. As time goes on it acquires
might and gradually becomes established and institutional,
by which time it has ceased to be right in the
most vital sense, and something else has taken its place.
In this way right is might in the making, while might is
right in its old age. Unless we felt the established as
wrong, we could not improve it. The tendency of every
form of settled power—ruling classes, the creeds of the
church, the formulas of the law, the dogmas of the lecture-room,
business customs—is bound to be at variance with
our ideal. The conflict between might and right is permanent,
and is the very process by which we get on.</p>

<p class='c010'>This way of stating the case would seem to indicate
that it is right that precedes and makes might, that a
thing comes to power because it appeals to conscience.
But it is equally true that might makes right, because
ruling conditions help to form our conscience. As our
moral ideals develop and we strive to carry them out,
we are driven to compromise and to accept as right, principles
which will work; and what will work depends in
great part on the existing organization, that is, on might.
If an idea proves wholly and hopelessly impracticable, it
will presently cease to be looked upon as right. The belief
in Christian principles of conduct as right would
never have persisted if they were as impracticable as is
often alleged; they are, on the contrary, widely practised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>in simple relations, and so appeal to most of us as
pointing the way to reasonable improvement in life at
large.</p>

<p class='c013'>Might and right, then, are stages in the social process,
the former having more maturity of organization. They
both spring from the general organism of life, and interact
upon each other. That which proves hopelessly
weak can hardly hold its place as right, but no more can
anything remain strong if it is irreconcilably opposed to
conscience. A heresy in religion is at first assailed by the
powers that be as wrong, but if it proves in the conflict
to have an intrinsic might, based on its fitness to meet
the mental situation, it comes to be acknowledged as
right. On the other hand, a system, like militarism, may
seem to be the very incarnation of might, and yet if it is
essentially at variance with the trend of human life, it
will prove to be weak. Behind both might and right is
something greater than either, to which both are responsible,
namely, the organic whole of onward life.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>FAME AS SURVIVAL—SYMBOLISM THE ROOT OF FAME—PRESENT
SIGNIFICANCE ESSENTIAL—THE ELEMENT OF MYTH—INFLUENCE
OF THE LITERARY CLASS—THE GROUP FACTOR—IS FAME JUST?—IS
IT DECAYING?</p>

<p class='c010'>Fame, I suppose, is a more extended leadership, the
man’s name acting as a symbol through which a personality,
or rather the idea we form of it, is kept alive and
operative for indefinite time. As ideas about persons are
the most active part of our individual thought, so personal
fames are the most active part of the social tradition.
They float on the current of history not dissolved into
impersonality but individual and appealing, and often
become more alive the longer the flesh is dead. Biography,
real or imaginary, is what we care for most in the
past, because it has the fullest message of life.</p>

<p class='c013'>Evidently fame must arise by a process of survival;
if one name has it and another does not, it is because the
former has in some way appealed more effectively to a
state of the human mind, and this not to one person or
one time only, but again and again, and to many persons,
until it has become a tradition. There must be
something about it perennially life-giving, something
that has power to awaken latent possibility and enable
us to be what we could not be without it. The real fames,
then, as distinguished from the transitory reputations of
the day, must have a value for human nature itself, for
those conditions of the mind that are not created by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>passing fashions or institutions, but outlive these and
give rise to a permanent demand.</p>

<p class='c013'>Or, if the appeal is to an institution, it must be to one
of a lasting sort, like a nation or the Christian Church.
As Americans we cherish the names of Washington and
Lincoln because they symbolize and animate the national
history; but even these are felt to belong in the front
rank only in so far as they were great men and not merely
great Americans.</p>

<p class='c010'>The one great reason why men are famous is that in
one way or another they have come to symbolize traits
of an ideal life. Their names are charged with daring,
hope, love, power, devotion, beauty, or truth, and we
cherish them because human nature is ever striving after
these things.</p>

<p class='c013'>It will be hard to find any kind of fame that is wholly
lacking in this ideal element. All the known crimes and
vices can be found attached to famous names, but there
is always something else, some splendid self-confidence,
some grandiose project, some faith, passion, or vision,
to give them power. It may not be quite true to say,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“One accent of the Holy Ghost</div>
      <div class='line'>The heedless world hath never lost”;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>but it is certain that there is nothing to which the ear of
the world is so sensitive as to such accents, or which,
having heard, it is less willing to forget. Every scrap of
real inspiration, whether in art or conduct, is treasured
up, when once it has been recorded, and is fairly certain
to prove <i><span lang="la">ære perennius</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>A great vitality belongs, however, to anything which
can bring the ideal down out of its abstractness and make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>it active and dramatic. A dramatic appeal is an appeal
to human nature as a whole, instead of to a specialized
intellectual faculty, to plain men as well as educated, and
to educated men through that plainer part of them which
is, after all, the most fully alive. So men of action have
always a first lien on fame, other things being equal—Garibaldi,
for example, with his picturesque campaigns,
red shirt and childlike personality, over the other heroes
of Italian liberation. And next to this comes the advantage
of being preserved for us in some form of art
which makes the most of any dramatic possibilities a
man may have, and often adds to them by invention.
Gibbon, Macaulay, Scott, not to speak of Shakespeare,
have done much to guide the course of fame for English
readers.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps it was this survival of salient personal traits,
often trivial or fictitious, that Bacon had in mind when he
remarked “for the truth is, that time seemeth to be of
the nature of a river or stream, which carrieth down to
us that which is light and blown up, and drowneth that
which is weighty and solid.”<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c014'><sup>[25]</sup></a> But, after all, traits of
personality may be as weighty and solid as anything else;
and where they are inspiring it is right that they should
be immortal. The merely trivial, of this kind, seldom
endures except by association with something of real
significance.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is noteworthy that what a man did for humanity in
the past is not the chief cause of fame, and not sufficient
to insure it unless he can keep on doing something in the
present. The world has little or no gratitude. If the
past contribution is the only thing and there is nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>presently animating in the living idea of a man, it will
use the former, without caring where it came from, and
forget the latter.</p>

<p class='c013'>The inventors who made possible the prodigious mechanical
progress of the past century are, for the most
part, forgotten; only a few names, such as those of
Watt, Stephenson, Fulton, Whitney, and Morse being
known, and those dimly, to the public. Some, like Palissy
the potter, are remembered for the fascination of their
biography, their heroic persistence, strokes of good fortune
or the like; and probably it is safe to conclude that
few men of this class would be famous for their inventions
alone.</p>

<p class='c013'>As Doctor Johnson remarks in The Rambler,<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c014'><sup>[26]</sup></a> the very
fact that an idea is wholly successful may cause its originator
to be forgotten. “It often happens that the general
reception of a doctrine obscures the books in which
it was delivered. When any tenet is generally received
and adopted as an incontrovertible principle, we seldom
look back to the arguments upon which it was first established,
or can bear that tediousness of deduction and
multiplicity of evidence by which its author was forced
to reconcile it to prejudice and fortify it in the weakness
of novelty against obstinacy and envy.” He instances
“Boyle’s discovery of the qualities of the air”; and I suppose
that if Darwin’s views could have been easily accepted,
instead of meeting the bitter and enduring opposition
of theological and other traditions, his popular
fame would have been comparatively small. He is
known to the many chiefly as the symbol of a militant
cause.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is, then, present function, not past, which is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>cause of fame, and any change which diminishes or enhances
this has a parallel effect upon reputation. Thus
the fame of Roger Bacon was renewed after an obscurity
of six centuries, because it came to be seen that he was a
significant forerunner of contemporary scientific thought;
and Mendel, whose discovery of a formula of heredity
was at first ignored, became famous when biology advanced
to a point where it could appreciate his value.
There are many cases in the annals of art of men, like
Tintoretto or Rembrandt, whose greatest fame was not
attained until the coming of a later generation more in
harmony with them than were their contemporaries.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is because fame exists for our present use and not to
perpetuate a dead past that myth enters so largely into
it. What we need is a good symbol to help us think and
feel; and so, starting with an actual personality which
more or less meets this need, we gradually improve upon
it by a process of unconscious adaptation that omits the
inessential and adds whatever is necessary to round out
the ideal. Thus the human mind working through tradition
is an artist, and creates types which go beyond
nature. In this way, no doubt, were built up such legendary
characters as Orpheus, Hercules, or King Arthur,
while the same factor enters into the fame of historical
persons like Joan of Arc, Richard I, Napoleon, and even
Washington and Lincoln. It is merely an extension of
that idealization which we apply to all the objects of our
hero-worship, whether dead or living.</p>

<p class='c013'>And where a historical character becomes the symbol
of a perennial ideal, as in the case of Jesus, his fame becomes
a developing institution, changing its forms with
successive generations and modes of thought, according
to the needs of the human spirit. This, apparently, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>the genesis of all life-giving conceptions of divine personality.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are aspects of fame that cannot be understood
without considering the special influence upon it of the
literary class. This class has control of the medium of
communication through which fame chiefly works, and
so exerts a power over it somewhat analogous to the power
of the financial class over trade; in both cases the forces
of demand and supply are transformed by the interests of
the mediating agent.</p>

<p class='c013'>One result of this is that literary fame is, of all kinds,
the most justly assigned. Candidates for it, of any merit,
are rarely overlooked, because there is always a small society
of inquiring experts eager and able to rescue from
oblivion any trait of kindred genius. They are not exempt
from conventionalism and party spirit, which may
make them unjust to contemporaries, but a second or
third generation is sure to search out anything that deserves
to survive, and reject the unworthy. “There is
no luck in literary reputation. They who make up the
final verdict upon every book are not the partial and
noisy readers of the hour when it appears; but a court
as of angels, a public not to be bribed, not to be entreated,
and not to be overawed, decides upon every
man’s title to fame. Only those books come down which
deserve to last.”<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c014'><sup>[27]</sup></a> In this way, by the reiterated selection
of an expert class with power to hand on their judgments,
there is a sure evolution of substantial fame.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="de">Was glaenzt ist für den Augenblick geboren,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de">Das Echte bleibt der Nachwelt unverloren.</span>”<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c014'><sup>[28]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The popular judgment of the hour has little to do with
the matter, one way or the other. An author may be a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>“best seller,” like Walter Scott, or almost unread, like
Wordsworth, and fare equally well with the higher court;
though in this as in all departments of life most contemporary
reputations prove transitory, because their “fitness”
is to a special and passing phase of the human mind,
and not to its enduring needs.</p>

<p class='c013'>However, literary reputation also has its symbolism,
and a name may come to be remembered as the type of
a school or a tendency rather than strictly on its own
merits. Sainte-Beuve, an authority on such a matter,
remarks in his essay on Villon: “But the essential thing,
I see clearly, even in literature, is to become one of
those names convenient to posterity, which uses them
constantly, which employs them as the <em>résumé</em> of many
others, and which, as it becomes more remote, not being
able to reach the whole extent of the chain, measures
the distance from one point to another only by
some shining link.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Democracy does not in the least alter the fact that
literary fame is assigned by a small but perpetual group
of experts. In one sense the process is always democratic;
in another it is never so: there is democracy in that all
may share in the making of fame who have discrimination
enough to make their opinion count, but the number
of these is always small, and they constitute, in this field,
a kind of self-made aristocracy, not of professed critics
alone, but of select readers intelligently seeking and enjoying
the best. The fame of men of letters, philosophers,
artists, indeed of nearly all sorts of great men, reaches the
majority only as the people outside the grounds hear the
names of the players shouted by those within. We know
who it was that was great, but just why he was so we
should, if put to it, be quite unable to tell.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>This certainty and justice of literary fame, which distinguish
it sharply from other kinds, depend not only
upon the literary class but upon the precision of the
record—the fact that the deed upon which the fame rests
is imperishable and unalterable—and also upon the extremely
personal and intimate character of the achievement
itself, which makes it comparatively independent of
external events, and capable of being valued for its own
sake at any time and by anybody competent to appreciate
it. It is more fortunate in this respect than political
achievement, which is involved with transient institutional
conditions.</p>

<p class='c013'>For similar reasons the other and non-literary sorts of
fame are certain and enduring very much in proportion
as they interest the literary class. The latter, being artists
or critics of art, have a natural predilection for other
arts as well as their own, and cherish the fame of painters,
sculptors, actors, and musicians. Actors, especially,
whose art leaves no record of its own, would scarcely be
remembered were it not for the enthusiasm of literary
admirers, like Lamb and Hazlitt and Boswell. As to
painting or sculpture, thousands of us who have little
direct knowledge or appreciation of the great names have
learned to cherish them at second hand through the fascination
of what has been written by admiring men of
letters. On the other hand, the comparative neglect of
inventors, engineers, and the captains of industry and
commerce is due in great part to their not appealing
strongly to the literary type of mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>If one’s work has no universal appeal to human nature,
nor any special attraction for the literary class, it may
yet survive in memory if there is a continuing technical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>group, with a recorded tradition, to which it is significant.
Professions, like law, surgery, and engineering; the
branches of scientific research, as astronomy, geology,
and bacteriology; long-lived practical interests, like horticulture
and breeding; even traditional sports and pastimes,
like golf, yachting, pugilism, and football, have their
special records in which are enshrined the names of heroes
who will not be forgotten so long as the group endures.
A tradition of this kind has far more power over time
than the acclaim of all the newspapers of the day, which
indeed, without the support of a more considerate judgment,
is <i><span lang="la">vox et præterea nihil</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>I can see no reason to expect that the men of our day
who are notable for vast riches, or even for substantial
economic leadership in addition to riches, will be remembered
long after their deaths. This class of people have
been soon forgotten in the past, and the case is not now
essentially different. They have no lasting spiritual
value to preserve their names, nor yet do they appeal to
the admiration and loyalty of a continuous technical
group. Their services, though possibly greater than those
of statesmen and soldiers who will be remembered, are of
the sort that the world appropriates without much commemoration.</p>

<p class='c013'>A group which is important as a whole, and holds the
eye of posterity for that reason, preserves the names of
many individual members of no great importance in
themselves. They help each other to burn, like sticks
in a heap, when each one by itself might go out. English
statesmen and men of letters have a great advantage over
American in this respect, because they belong to a more
centralized and interrelated society. To know Burke
and Goldsmith and Johnson is also to know Garrick and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>Boswell, and Mrs. Thrale, Fox, North, Pitt, Sheridan,
Walpole, and many others, who, like characters in a play,
are far more taken together than the mere sum of the
individuals. Indeed a culture group and epoch of this
kind <em>is</em> a sort of play, appealing to a complex historical
and dramatic interest, and animating personalities by
their membership in the whole. We love to domesticate
ourselves in it, when we might not care greatly for the individuals
in separation.</p>

<p class='c013'>So every “great epoch”—the Age of Pericles in Athens,
of Augustus in Rome, of the Medici in Florence, of Elizabeth
in England, gives us a group of names which shine
by the general light of their time. And in the same way
a whole nation or civilization which has a unique value
for mankind may give immortality to a thousand persons
and events which might otherwise be insignificant. Of
this the best illustration is, no doubt, the Hebrew nation
and history, as we have it in the Bible, which unites patriarchs,
kings, prophets, apostles and minor characters
in one vast symbol.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another influence of similar character is the knowledge
and feeling that the fame in question is accepted and social,
so that we are part of a fellowship to be moved by it. I
take it that much of the delight that people have in reading
Horace comes from the sense of being in the company
not only of Horace but of hundreds of Horace-spirited
readers. We love things more genially when we know
that others have loved them before us.</p>

<p class='c010'>The question whether fame is just, considered as a reward
to the individual, must on the whole be answered:
No, especially if, for the reasons already given, we except
the literary class. Justice in this sense has little to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>with the function of fame as a symbol for impressing certain
ideas and sentiments and arousing emulation. What
name best meets this purpose is determined partly by
real service, but largely by opportuneness, by publicity,
by dramatic accessories, and by other circumstances
which, so far as the individual is concerned, may be called
luck. “So to order it that actions may be known and
seen is purely the work of fortune,” says Montaigne,
“’tis chance that helps us to glory.... A great many
brave actions must be expected to be performed without
witness, and so lost, before one turns to account; a man
is not always on the top of a breach or at the head of an
army,&#160;... a man is often surprised betwixt the hedge
and the ditch; he must run the hazard of his life against a
hen-roost, he must dislodge four rascally musketeers from
a barn;&#160;... and whoever will observe will, I believe,
find it experimentally true that occasions of the least
lustre are ever the most dangerous.”<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c014'><sup>[29]</sup></a> It is no less true,
I suppose, in the wars of our day, and of a hundred soldiers
equally brave and resourceful, only one gets the
cross of honor. In a high sense this is not only for the
man who happens to receive it, but for a company of
nameless heroes of whom he is the symbol.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so in all history; it is partly a matter of chance
which name the myth crystallizes about, especially in
those earlier times when the critical study of biography
was unknown. We are not certain that Solomon was
really the wisest man, or Orpheus the sweetest singer, or
Sir Philip Sidney the most perfect gentleman, but it is
convenient to have names to stand for these traits. In
general, history is no doubt far more individual, more a
matter of a few great names, than is accomplishment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Mankind does things and a few names get the credit.
Sir Thomas Browne expressed the truth very moderately
when he said that there have been more remarkable persons
forgotten than remembered.</p>

<p class='c010'>We hear rumors of the decay of fame: it is said that
“modern life&#160;... favors less and less the growth and
preservation of great personalities”;<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c014'><sup>[30]</sup></a> but I see no proof
of it and doubt whether such a decay is conformable to
human nature. Other epochs far enough past to give
time for selection and idealization have left symbolic
names, and the burden of proof is upon those who hold
that ours will not. I do not doubt there is a change;
we are coming to see life more in wholes than formerly;
but I conceive that our need to see it as persons is not
diminished.</p>

<p class='c013'>Has there not come to be a feeling, especially during
the Great War, that the desire for fame is selfish and a
little outgrown, that the good soldier of humanity does
not care for it? I think so; but it seems to me that we
must distinguish, as to this, between one who is borne
up on a great human whole that lives in the looks and
voices of those about him, like a soldier in a patriotic
war, or a workman in the labor movement, and one who
is more or less isolated, as are nearly all men of unique
originality. The latter, I imagine, will always feel the
need to believe in the appreciation of posterity; they will
appeal from the present to the future and, like Dante,
meditate <i><span lang="it">come l’uom s’eterna</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The desire for fame is simply a larger form of personal
ambition, and in one respect, at least, nobler than other
forms, in that it reflects the need to associate ourselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>with some enduring reality, raised above the accidents of
time. “Nay, I am persuaded that all men do all things,
and the better they are the more they do them, in hope
of the glorious fame of immortal virtue; for they desire
the immortal.”<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c014'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>It is the “last infirmity of noble minds,” if it be an infirmity
at all, and few of the greatest of the earth have
been without it. All of us would regard it as the mark of
a superior mind to wish to <em>be</em> something of imperishable
worth, but, social beings as we are, we can hardly separate
this wish from that for social recognition of the worth.
The alleged “vanity” of the desire for fame is vanity only
in the sense that all idealism is empty for those who can
see the real only in the tangible.</p>

<p class='c013'>And yet it would be a finer thing to “desire the immortal”
without requiring it to be stained with the color
of our own mortality.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XII<br> <span class='c011'>THE COMPETITIVE SPIRIT</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>ADVANTAGES OF COMPETITION—WHY MODERN CIVILIZATION DOES
NOT ENERVATE—COMPETITION AND SYMPATHY—HIGHER AND
LOWER COMPETITIVE SPIRIT—THE PECUNIARY MOTIVE—IS EMULATION
IN SERVICE PRACTICABLE?—LOWER MOTIVES INEFFICIENT—THE
“ECONOMIC MAN”</p>

<p class='c010'>There used to be much condemnation of our present
state of society based on the idea that competition is a
bad thing in itself, a state of war where we want a state
of peace, generating hostile passions where we need sympathy
and love. It seems, however, that we are coming
to recognize that all life is struggle, that any system which
is alive and progressive must be, in some sense, competitive,
and that the real question at issue is that of the <em>kind</em>
of competition, whether it is free, just, kindly, governed
by good rules and worthy objects, or the reverse.</p>

<p class='c013'>The diffusion of personal opportunity, and of the competition
through which alone it can be realized, has a remarkable
effect in awakening energy and inciting ambition.
In so far as a man can and does live without any
exacting test of himself he fails to achieve significant character
and self-reliant manhood. It is by permitting this
and so relaxing the tissue of personal character that static
societies and classes have decayed in the past. On the
contrary, one who has made his way in a competitive society
has learned to choose his course, to select and develop
one class of influences and reject others, to measure
the result in practice, and so to gain self-knowledge and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>an effective will. The simplest workman, accustomed to
make his way, becomes something of a diplomatist, a
student of character, a man of the world.</p>

<p class='c010'>It has been thought rather a mystery that modern
civilization does not enervate men as the ancient is believed
to have done. In the case of the Roman and
earlier empires the natural course of things, apparently,
was for a vigorous nation, after a career of conquest, to
become rich, luxurious, degenerate, and finally to be conquered
by tribes emerging from savagery and hardihood
to follow a similar course. In our days it seems that a
people may remain civilized for centuries without loss of
their militant energy, and, roughly speaking, the nations
who have advanced most in the arts of peace display also
the most prowess in war.</p>

<p class='c013'>The main reason for this I take to be that modern civilization
preserves within itself that element of conflict
which gives the training in courage and hardihood that
was formerly possible only in a savage state. The ancient
civilizations were in their nature repressive; they could
achieve order and industry over wide areas only by imposing
a mechanical and coercive discipline, which left
little room for individual development and accustomed
the mass of men to routine and servility. Thus we read,
regarding Rome, that “The despotic imperial administration
upheld for a long while the Roman Empire, and
not without renown; but it corrupted, enervated, and impoverished
the Roman populations, and left them, after
five centuries, as incapable of defending themselves as
they were of governing.”<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c014'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Much has been said of the need of a moral equivalent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>for war, in order that we may dispense with the latter
without losing our virile traits; but it may well be thought
that as a sphere for individual combativeness, for daring,
resolution, self-reliance and pertinacity, our civil life
is, on the whole, far superior to war, which requires a
strict and somewhat mechanical type of discipline, putting
only a limited responsibility on the soldier. Indeed
the attractiveness to the imagination of military service
lies largely in this very fact, that it is non-competitive,
that it promises to take one out of the turmoil of individualistic
struggle and give him a moral rest. It offers the
repose of subordination, the “peace of the yoke,” and
many have enlisted, very much as many others have
sought the cloister, to escape from harassing responsibilities
and live under rule.</p>

<p class='c010'>The idea that competition is always destructive of
sympathy will not bear examination. It may be destructive
or it may not, depending, among other things, on
whether it is fair, whether the rules are well understood
and enforced, whether the objects striven for are ennobling
or otherwise, and whether the competitor has been properly
trained to run his course. Injustice, lack of standards,
low aims and unfitness generate bad feeling, because the
individual has not the sense of doing his part in a worthy
whole. A good kind of competition will be felt to be also
a kind of co-operation, a working out, through selection,
of one’s special function in the common enterprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Indeed it is chiefly through competition that we come
to know the world, to get a various insight into peoples’
minds, and so to achieve a large kind of sympathy; while
those who lead a protected life generally lack a robust
breadth of view and sense of justice. A man, like Abraham
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Lincoln, who has worked his way from bottom to
top of a society everywhere competitive, may still be,
as he was, a man of notable tenderness, as well as of a
reach of sympathy which only this experience could develop.</p>

<p class='c010'>I take it, then, that real progress in this regard consists
not in abolishing the competitive spirit but in raising it
to higher levels, and that the questions just what this
means, and whether it is practicable, and how, are the
ones we need to discuss.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suppose that we make a rough division between <em>the
lower self-seeking</em> and <em>emulation in service</em>. The distinction
is based mainly on whether the self-assertion, present
in both cases, is or is not suffused and dominated by devotion
to the common good. The lower spirit would include
all merely sensual impulses, as hunger, cold, and the
like, and also more imaginative motives, such as the fear
of want, the greed of acquisition, the love of power, the
passion for display, the excitement of rivalry, even the
love of honor and renown, so long as these are merely
personal, and include no conscious loyalty and service
to a common ideal. It is lower, of course, not in the sense
that it is always morally wrong, but from the point of
view of a higher or lower appeal to human nature. In
this respect we must regard as lower even the struggles
of a man to provide for his family, so long as he, with his
family, form a mere self-asserting unit with no sense of
co-operation with other units.</p>

<p class='c013'>Emulation in service does not displace other impulses,
but suffuses them with a sense of devotion to a larger
whole, so that they are modified, elevated, controlled, or
even suppressed by the immanence of this greater idea.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Rivalry and the pursuit of honor will remain, but under
the discipline of “team-work” so that the individual will
always, at need, prefer the good of the whole to his personal
glory. A man will strive to meet the wants of himself
and his family, but along with these, and more present
to his imagination because larger and more animating,
will be the sense of service to some public and enduring
ideal.</p>

<p class='c010'>I do not wish to overlook or depreciate the pecuniary
motive. As a symbol of control over the more tangible
goods of life money rightly plays a large part in guiding
and stimulating our efforts. The motive back of such
efforts is in no way revealed by the fact that they seek to
work themselves out through pecuniary acquisition, but
may be very selfish or quite the opposite. A man may
want money for drink, or opium, or for a good book, or
to help a friend, or to save the life of a sick child. The
money is rather a derivative than an original motive,
except as we may come to love it for its own sake; it is
a mechanism indispensable to the organization of life.
And the precise measurement and adjustment of pecuniary
reward and service, in the more tangible kinds of
production, with increased pay for increased efficiency—such
as is attempted in the new science of management—is
a logical development of the price system and should
have good results.</p>

<p class='c013'>But this sort of motivation is wholly inadequate to the
higher incitement of human nature. It takes hold of us,
for the most part, in a somewhat superficial way, and if
allowed to guide rather than follow the deeper currents
of character, it degrades us into avarice and materialism.
Certainly that is a poor sort of man to whom it offers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>the only or the chief inducement to endeavor. He is
not fully alive in his higher parts, a mercenary recruit
in the social army rather than a patriot fighting for
love and honor. The best men choose their occupation
because they love it, and believe they can do something
worthy and lasting in it, though, like nearly all of us,
they are much guided as to details by the pecuniary
market.</p>

<p class='c013'>We may, then, take for granted the working of this inducement,
in its proper sphere, and go on to consider the
motives that lie deeper.<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c014'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>I suppose most of us would admit that emulation in
service is desirable and is actually operative in some quarters,
but would question whether it is not too high to be
generally practicable.</p>

<p class='c013'>It does not appear, however, to be limited to exceptionally
high kinds of persons. It quite generally prevails
in school and college athletics, where much hard
work and self-denial is undergone without inducement
of any kind except a collective enthusiasm which makes
each one feel that the success of the team is more than
any glory that may come to himself. Yet no one will
claim that human nature in college students is much
above the average. And what shall we say of soldiers,
who are ordinary men, drawn from all classes of society,
but who soon learn to value the honor of their company
or regiment so high that they are eager to risk their lives
for it, and that without any hope of private reward?
Public spirit is congenial to human nature, and we may
expect everything from it, even the utmost degree of self-sacrificing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>service, if only the public cause is brought
home to our hearts.</p>

<p class='c013'>Even in our present confused and selfish scheme of
economic life the best work is largely done under the impulse
of service emulation. This is the case, for example,
in most of the professions. Teachers are glad to get as
much money for their work as they can, but what all
good teachers are thinking about in the course of their
labors, and what sustains and elevates them, is the service
they hope they are doing to the common life. The
same is true of doctors, engineers, men of science, and,
let us hope, lawyers, journalists, and public officials.
The library service has aptly been cited as an example
of the energy and efficiency which may be attained under
the higher emulation with little or no appeal to pecuniary
ambition. Librarians are paid by salaries, which are
moderate at most, and not at all sure to increase with
success, yet in no social function, perhaps, has there been
displayed more zeal, devotion, and initiative, or more
remarkable progress in serving the public. I may add
that the good books, to disseminate which the library
exists, were produced in a spirit of honor and service and
not, chiefly, for gain.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nor can there be much doubt that a great part of mechanical
workmen, having a skilled trade into which it is
possible to put interest and a progressive spirit, are animated
by the sense of sharing in a great productive whole.
Perhaps, like most of us, they need at times the spur of
knowing that they <em>must</em> work, but this is not what is
most present to their imaginations or elicits their best
endeavors. The wage question, as the focus of controversy,
is kept before our minds and leads us, I believe,
to exaggerate the part which pecuniary calculations play
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>in the mind of the handicraftsman. For the most part
he resembles the teacher or doctor in that he wishes to
think no more about money in connection with his work
than he feels he has to. The mechanics I see about me—plumbers,
masons, furnace-men and the like—are as
full of the zest of life as any class; they like the struggle,
the sense of hope and power and honest service.</p>

<p class='c013'>How far the same is true of business men I shall not
attempt to say; certainly more than theories of the “economic
man” would lead us to expect; yet here, without
doubt, we have the class in which a pecuniary individualism
is most rife and in which there is most need to foster
a higher spirit.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is a trend throughout society to substitute higher
motives for lower, and this is not only because the former
are more agreeable, but because they are more effectual.
It was formerly thought that school children would not
learn to read, write, and spell without constant fear and
frequent experience of the rod; but now good schools
dispense entirely with this incentive, and find emulation
and the pleasure of achievement more efficacious. In the
church the fear of hell fire is being supplanted by appeals
to love, loyalty, and service. Even those convicted of
crime, it is believed, can be more easily managed and with
better results to themselves by a discipline which appeals
to their self-respect and gives them a chance to show that
they are men like the rest of us. Fear is a poor motive,
because it does not evoke those energies that are bound
up with ambition, sympathy, social imagination, and hope.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is gratifying to find that the organizers of industry
are coming to ascribe more and more value to human
sympathy and the golden rule. In an article by a manufacturer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>published in a business magazine, I read that
the aim in handling men is to bring about a “family feeling.”
“The best way to hold them is to know them....
It is important not to drive. Fear of the boss never inspired
any real team-work, and no good working force was
ever built up without team-work. The men in positions
of responsibility must make the men under them really
want to work with and for them.”<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c014'><sup>[34]</sup></a> Another manufacturer,
a man of phenomenal success, says: “It is the easiest
thing in the world to inspire this loyalty, but it is not
to be done by any trick. It’s simply a matter of honest
and sincere understanding of the workman’s interests, a
recognition of his ambitions as a human being. If your
men feel that is your attitude toward them they will do
their best every hour of the day.”<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c014'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In so far, then, as our social order fails to cultivate the
sense of willing service in a worthy whole it is failing in
higher efficiency. In great part the actual working is as
if we formed an army of intelligent and high-spirited
men, and proceeded to drive them to their duty by the
lash, as was formerly done, instead of appealing to patriotism
and the emulation of regiments and companies,
as in modern armies. It operates on a low plane of discipline
and without the spiritual co-operation of the
agent.</p>

<p class='c013'>No doubt there are workers, under existing conditions,
who take no pride in their work and will not work at all,
perhaps, except when they are driven to it by the fear of
want. But there is reason to think that these are chiefly
those who have had a brutalizing and discouraging experience.
A good military officer will recruit a company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>of just such men, and after a few months of discipline
have them eager to excel in their duty and ready to face
death. It is all a matter of how they are appealed to.
And is it not the case, also, that there is a large class in
industry who display more pride in their work and sense
of duty and service regarding it, than could reasonably
be expected, in view of the inconsiderate, mechanical, and
selfish way in which they are commonly treated? If a
man finds that he is hired when he is a source of gain
and turned off when he is not; treated usually without
personal appreciation and often with harshness, and set
at monotonous work whose value to the world is not easy
to feel; it would hardly be supposed that he would show
much loyalty or spirit of service, and yet many do, under
just such conditions. The truth is that human nature
needs to believe in life, and even as we see that people
cling to the goodness of God when he seems to send them
nothing but misfortunes, so they often show more loyalty
to the economic order than it appears to deserve.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is almost certain that the grosser forms of economic
want and terror, like corporal punishment in the schoolroom,
paralyze rather than stimulate the energies of society.
This liability to starvation and freezing, degradation
and contempt for not having money in one’s pocket,
with no inquiry why, this nightmare of evil to be averted
not by service but by money, and only money, no matter
how you get it—this is overdoing the pecuniary motive.
It brutalizes the imagination and creates an unhuman
dread that impels to sensuality and despair.</p>

<p class='c013'>I do not deny that there will be shirkers under any
system, but it seems plain that their numbers are rather
increased than diminished by harshness and neglect, and
will be reduced in proportion as we make the whole life,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>from infancy onward, one that develops self-respect, hope
and ambition.</p>

<p class='c013'>The argument for savagery—<i><span lang="la">facilis descensus Averni</span></i>—is
much the same in all spheres of life. A parent beats a
child, and, finding him still recalcitrant, thinks he needs
more beating; a teacher whose suspicious methods and
appeals to fear have alienated his scholars is all for more
suspicion and intimidation; an employer who, having
made no effort to gain the confidence of his men, finds
that they are disloyal, is convinced that nothing but repression
can solve the labor question; the people that
are trying to control the negro by terrorism and lynching
believe that more of these methods is the remedy for increasing
negro crime; governments exasperate each other
into war by ill will and hostile preparations, and then
argue that, war being inevitable, ill will and hostile preparations
are the only rational course to take. We shall
never get out of these vicious circles until we take our
stand on the higher possibilities of human nature, as shown
by experience under right conditions, and proceed to develop
these by faith and common sense.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the main forces in keeping economic motive on
a low moral level has been the doctrine that selfishness is
all we need or can hope to have in this phase of life.
Economists have too commonly taught that if each man
seeks his private interest the good of society will take care
of itself, and the somewhat anarchic conditions of the
time have discouraged a better theory. In this way we
have been confirmed in a pernicious state of belief and
practice, for which discontent, inefficiency, and revolt are
the natural penalty. A social system based on this doctrine
deserves to fail.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>When pressed regarding this matter economists have
not denied that their system rests on a partial and abstract
view of human nature; but they have held that
this view is practically adequate in the economic field,
and have often seemed to believe that it sufficed for all
but a negligible part of human life. On the contrary, it
is false even as economics, and we shall never have an
efficient system until we have one that appeals to the
imagination, the loyalty, and the self-expression of the
men who serve it.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIII<br> <span class='c011'>THE HIGHER EMULATION</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>GENERAL CONDITIONS OF A HIGHER EMULATION—SUPPORT BY A
GROUP SPIRIT—A SENSE OF SECURITY—SELF-EXPRESSION—CONCLUSION</p>

<p class='c010'>The condition under which human nature will be
ruled by emulation in service is, in general, simple. It
is that one be immersed in a group spirit and organization
of which such emulation is a part. If we have this,
no unusual virtue is required to call out devotion and
sacrifice, only the ordinary traits of loyalty and suggestibility.
In college athletics or in a regiment a man is
surrounded by good fellows with whom he is in ardent
sympathy, all whose thoughts are bent upon the success
of the group. It is not only that he knows he has his
own glory or shame at stake, but more than this, the
spirit of the whole flows in upon him and submerges his
separate personality, until that spirit really is himself.
He does not count the cost but lives and acts in the larger
life. It is said of one of the national armies, “each man
is for his company, each company is for its regiment,
each regiment is for the army, and the army is for the
collective honor of them all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The complete merging of self-consciousness is for times
of special enthusiasm, but if the intimate group is lasting
it forms a habit of thought and feeling that dominates
the ambition and conscience of the individual, so that
what would otherwise be a selfish struggle for power is
raised to emulation in the service of the group. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>man of science toiling in his laboratory is ennobled and
supported by the sense of a great whole in which he is
working, and of other men, his comrades and rivals,
whose opinions will reward and immortalize his discoveries.
So it is with the various branches of literature, with the
fine arts, and with all the true professions. Indeed this
is just the distinguishing trait of a true profession, that
it should have a continuing spirit and tradition capable
of moulding to high issues the minds of its members.
And we might say that the aim of reform, as regards
motivation, is to make every social function a true profession.
It would seem that there is no function so distasteful
that it might not conceivably be ennobled in
this way. What could be more repellent at first view
than much of the work of the surgeon or the nurse?
Yet we see how it is transformed by group consciousness
and pride.</p>

<p class='c010'>The existence of a group spirit and tradition implies
several things whose power to raise and animate the
individual mind are manifest. Among these are social
emotion, standards of merit, and a certain sense of
security.</p>

<p class='c013'>We all know how hard it is to get up steam if each of
us has to build a little fire of his own and cannot draw
from any general reservoir of heat. Few men can go
ahead under such conditions, and those few do it at
a great expense of effort. On the other hand, nearly all of
us delight in sharing an emulative excitement, and a man
who, from pure lethargy, is almost worthless when working
alone may easily prove efficient in a group. I once
employed to cut and pile wood a man whom I had
seen doing wonders in a gang, but I found that it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>only in a gang that he would do anything at all. The
power to work energetically by oneself is a high quality
which we need to cultivate, but it exists only in limited
quantity, and even so is usually dependent upon imaginative
contact with a group.</p>

<p class='c013'>As to standards, it is in the nature of the continuing
thought of a group to cherish heroes, to set up ideals and
models of achievement, and to impress these upon the
members. The Christian Church has its central Example
and its noble army of saints and martyrs for the emulation
of the faithful, and every live organization, down
to the gang of bad boys in the alley, has something of the
same sort.</p>

<p class='c013'>These aims and symbols need to be high, definite, and
appealing, in order that they may instigate imagination
and effort; and to bring them to this condition requires
time and co-operative endeavor in the group as a whole.
Contemporary life in almost every department is weak
at this point; even where there is the most ardent good-will
it is apt to fail of results because of crude and uncompelling
standards.</p>

<p class='c010'>By a sense of security I mean the feeling that there is
a larger and more enduring life surrounding, appreciating,
upholding the individual, and guaranteeing that his
efforts and sacrifice will not be in vain. I might almost
say that it is a sense of immortality; if not that, it is something
akin to and looking toward it, something that relieves
the precariousness of the merely private self. It
is rare that human nature sustains a high standard of
behavior without the consciousness of opinions and sympathies
that illuminate the standard and make it seem
worth while. It lies deep in the social nature of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>minds that ideals can hardly seem real without such corroboration.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a still more tangible sense I mean a reasonable economic
security. A man can hardly have a good spirit if
he feels that the ground is unsure beneath his feet, that
his social world may disown and forget him to-morrow.
There is scarcely anything more appalling to the human
spirit than this feeling, or more destructive of all generous
impulses. It is an old observation that fear shrinks the
soul; and there is no fear like this. The soldier who knows
that he may be killed at any moment may yet be perfectly
secure in a psychological sense; secure of his duty
and of the sympathy of his fellows, his mind quite at
peace; but this treachery of the ground we stand on is
like a bad dream. As one will shrink from attaching
himself in love and service to a person whom he feels he
cannot trust, so he will from giving his loyalty to an insecure
position. It is impossible that such tenure of
function as now chiefly prevails in the industrial world
should not induce selfishness, restlessness, and a service
only mercenary.</p>

<p class='c013'>The member of a professional group or of a labor-union
gets security largely from his standing in the group,
which insures that if he is unjustly ousted from one
position he can rely upon getting another. It is natural,
however, that where this is the case his loyalty will be to
the group rather than to the employer. If the latter
treats men as machines he will get mechanical service.
Moreover, it is not to be expected that a man will give
his full loyalty and service to an employer merely as
such, as the source of his pay. To enlist his higher spirit
he must feel that the work itself is honorable, that he is
serving his country, humanity, and God.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>A nation can hardly preserve that interest and loyalty
which makes it truly strong unless it can so order things
that the individual feels the nation’s care for him, its eye
upon his virtues and failings, its appreciation of what he
has done, and readiness to stand by him in undeserved
trouble. Well-devised systems of education, assistance
in finding work, protection against injustice, advice and
temporary relief in difficulties, insurance against sickness,
accident, and old age—measures of this kind, supplementing,
but not supplanting, his own efforts, will go far to
make him a real patriot. An intricate society calls for
many helps which would formerly have been thought
paternal.</p>

<p class='c013'>The position of a university teacher, under prevalent
conditions, illustrates fairly well the benefits of a reasonable
security. After a period of probation, intended to
be exacting, he is given a permanent appointment which
is understood to be forfeitable only by misconduct, although
his promotion, which is gradual and extends over
a long period, depends upon the degree of his achievement.
An equal inducement to exert himself is the hope
of service, in teaching and research, and of the appreciation
of this by students and colleagues, a hope which is
almost certain to be realized if he does his part. He has
reason, also, to anticipate considerate treatment in sickness
or other trouble, and is often assured of a pension
in old age. The plan seems to work well in leading men
to labor faithfully and in calling forth a higher quality of
service than would be elicited by more stringent treatment.
One feels that he has the duty and opportunity
to put his very self into his function—his faith, his aspiration,
his originality, if he has any. Whatever inefficiency
may be found is to be attributed, I should say, not to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>principles of motivation, but either to defects in the
process by which men are chosen, or perhaps to the lack,
in some lines of teaching, of high and clear standards of
achievement. The favorable effect of a secure and yet
animating environment is beyond question.</p>

<p class='c010'>While it is not indispensable, in order to secure emulation
in service, that the work should allow of self-expression
and so be attractive in itself, yet in so far as we can
make it self-expressive we release fresh energies of the
human mind. The ideal condition is to have something
of the spirit of art in every task, a sense of joyous individual
creation. We are formed for development, and
an endless, hopeless repetition is justly abhorrent. No
matter how humble a man’s work, he will do it better
and in a better spirit if he sees that he can improve upon
it and hope to pass beyond it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Judged by such standards, our present order is inefficient,
because its tasks are so largely narrow, drudging,
meaningless, unhuman. An English writer has described
the pernicious influence of what he calls “the resentful
employee,” “the class of people who, without explanation,
adequate preparation, or any chance, have been shoved
at an early age into uncongenial work and never given a
chance to escape.” “He becomes an employee between
thirteen and fifteen; he is made to do work he does not
like for no other purpose, so far as he can see, except the
profit and glory of a fortunate person called his employer,
behind whom stand church and state blessing and upholding
the relationship.... He feels put upon and
cheated out of life.”<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c014'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>We do not help the individual to feel that he is contributing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>in his own way, to an interesting whole. It seems
that for this, as for so many other reasons, we must aim
at a greater sense of solidarity, to make the common life
more real and attractive, and the individual more conscious
of his part in it. The idea of freedom as developed
in our present institutions is somewhat empty, because
negative; we are apt to give a man the choice between
drudgery and anarchy, and when we find that we have
more of the latter than other nations we think it is because
we are so free.</p>

<p class='c010'>We need, then, a system of social groups, corresponding
to the system of functions in society, each group
having <em>esprit de corps</em>, emulation and standards within
itself, and all animated with a spirit of loyalty and service
to the whole. To achieve this would call for no change
in human nature, but only in the instigation and direction
of its impulses; it would mean chiefly firmer association
and clearer ideals of merit among those pursuing the several
functions. Pecuniary inducement would play a large
part in it, but would be dethroned from the sole and all-sufficing
position assigned to it in the prevalent economic
philosophy. Freedom, self-expression, and the competitive
spirit would be cherished, but could not degenerate
into irresponsible individualism.</p>

<p class='c013'>Much of our higher life is already organized in harmony
with this ideal, and we see it applied, in part at least, to
many private undertakings and to public enterprises like
the building of the Panama Canal. I believe that the
principle of emulation in service is one whose operation
can gradually be extended so as to take in the great body
of productive activity.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIV<br> <span class='c011'>DISCIPLINE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>LACK OF EXTERNAL DISCIPLINE IN AMERICA—A FREE DISCIPLINE
NEEDED—MUST BE BASED ON PURPOSE—RÔLE OF THE COMMUNITY
AND THE STATE—AN IDEAL OF DEMOCRATIC DISCIPLINE</p>

<p class='c010'>That American life, at least in times of peace, lacks
external discipline is grossly apparent. There is a wide-spread
want of that demeanor ordered by the sense of
some higher whole, which gives purpose, alertness, and
dignity to personal behavior. Our society is full of people,
of all ages and classes, who have more liberty, in the
sense of unrestriction, than they know how to use. Having
emancipated themselves from restraint and lacking
worthy ideals of what to do next, they spend themselves
in crude and inept behavior, not definitely harmful, perhaps,
but disgusting from the state of mind it displays.</p>

<p class='c013'>I am inclined to think there is something deceptive
about this apparent laxity, and that the American compares
well in real self-control with the individual of more
orderly societies. I feel quite sure from my own observation
that Germans, for example, young and old, give way
to unruly impulses more readily than Americans; indeed
a German scholar, resident in America, has fixed upon
self-possession as our most distinctive trait.<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c014'><sup>[37]</sup></a> What we
lack is external decorum and the marshalling of individual
self-controls into definite and visible forms of service.
American life is slipshod rather than anarchic.</p>

<p class='c010'>Evidently what we need, what the whole world needs,
is the growth of a free type of discipline, based on emulation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>in service rather than on coercion and mechanism.
This, if you can get it, is more truly disciplinary than anything
external; it takes hold of the individual by his
higher impulses, and leads him to identify his very self
with the whole he serves. One great task laid upon us
is to justify democracy by proving that it has a constructive
and disciplinary energy and is by no means the
mere individualism and spiritual disorder that its enemies
have charged.</p>

<p class='c013'>I should say that of two societies suffering equally, one
from too little external discipline, and the other from too
much, the former was in a more hopeful condition. It is,
other things equal, more adaptable, in an earlier and more
plastic stage of development. If the people are not lacking
in constructive power you may expect them to develop
as much discipline as they need. But a well-developed
formalism, on the other hand, is a mature,
rigid thing, not likely to transform itself into freedom by
a gradual process, capable of reform only through revolution.</p>

<p class='c010'>A free discipline is based upon a purpose; that is, the
individual must have an object which means so much to
him that he will control and guide his wayward impulses
in its interest. Of the power of patriotism to do this, in
times of national stress and awakening, we have seen
memorable examples. It would be superficial, however,
to imagine that it can be secured by compulsory military
training in times when the people are not convinced of
the imminence of military danger. The disciplinary value
of such training in Europe has been due to the fact
that the people, on the whole, have believed in it, regarding
it as the instrument of patriotic defense against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>the attack which they were taught to look upon as always
impending. I should say that only in so far as our
future situation is similar, can military preparation play
a vital part in it. If the world becomes peaceful, then
peaceful service must be the motive of discipline, though
it may well include a training capable of being turned
to military use.</p>

<p class='c013'>We get discipline from the activities that take hold of
us because they are real and functional. There is much
of it in school, if the teaching and atmosphere are such
that the scholars put themselves into the work. The
home life also supplies it, in so far as it awakens a similar
spirit; and one underlying reason for the partial decay
of discipline among us is the fact that the family has so
largely ceased to have active and definite functions, requiring
the co-operation of all the members, and so impressing
upon them a spirit of loyalty and service. It is
for this reason that we so commonly see a better discipline
in the hard-working families of the farming and
laboring classes than among people whose life is less
strenuous.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is no more effective means of discipline, in its
province, than organized play, mainly because it is voluntary
and joyous, so that the individual is eager to put
himself into it, while at the same time it requires perseverance
and team-work. The chief objection to it, as
we have it in America, is the spectacular character it
often has, the multitude looking on with a vicarious and
sterile excitement at the performance of the few who
alone get the discipline, which is itself impaired by the
excessive publicity.</p>

<p class='c013'>Women most commonly get their serious discipline
from the care of the household and children, and we see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>girls who have grown up frivolously in well-to-do families
transformed by the responsibilities that follow marriage.
For young men bread-winning work is a great disciplinary
agent. The struggle to “make good” in trade, business,
or profession, and establish one’s right to the respect of
his fellows and to a home and family of his own, provides
an object, commonly somewhat difficult to attain,
for the sake of which one must learn steadfastness and
self-control. This economic discipline is, on the whole,
an admirable thing in its way, and might be greatly
extended and improved by a more regular and adequate
training, in the schools and after, and by the development
of occupational groups. At the best, however,
a discipline based merely on the purpose to make
an income and position must be of a somewhat narrow
character, not necessarily leading up to any compelling
sense of loyalty to the community, the state, or mankind.</p>

<p class='c013'>The problem of discipline and the problem of ideals
are much the same. If we can awaken in ourselves a
social and socially religious spirit and ideal, our discipline
will come by the endeavor to give this spirit and ideal
expression.</p>

<p class='c010'>Our great lack, as regards higher discipline, has been
that we have had no habitual and moving vision of our
State. There has been a great deal of a vague kind of
patriotism, but it has generally lacked specific ideal,
purpose, and form. The ingrained habit of regarding
government as a minor part of life, a necessary evil, and
the pursuit of second-rate men, has diverted the spiritual
energies of our people from public channels, not only
impairing our national life and discrediting democracy,
but leaving the individual without that sense of public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>function which his own character requires. The religious
ardor which men willingly give to their country when they
feel their identity with it is the noblest basis for discipline,
and it remains for us to find a means of arousing
this other than the gross and obsolescent one of threatened
war. We need, along with the growth of freedom and
enlightenment, a growing vision of the nation as the incarnation
of our ideal, as an upbuilder of great enterprises,
as a friend and benefactor of other nations, and as an
honorable contestant in an international struggle for
leadership in industry, science, art, and every sort of
higher service. This might, perhaps, be made the motive
for some sort of universal service and training in connection
with the schools, which should be as peaceful in
spirit as the times permit, though capable of taking a
warlike direction if necessary. What a state like Germany
has done by the aid of militarism and bureaucracy, yet
with a large measure of success, we ought to do in our
own way, and do much better.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our discipline needs to be as diverse as our society.
A well-organized plan of life should embrace a system of
disciplinary groups corresponding to the chief aspects of
human endeavor, each one surrounding the individual
with an atmosphere of emulation and with ideals of a particular
sort. Democracy should not mean uniformity,
but the fullest measure of differentiation, a development
everywhere of special spirits—in communities, in occupations,
in culture groups, in distinctive personalities.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ideal discipline for democracy, I think, is one that
trusts unreservedly to the democratic principle. It should
begin in the family by making the life as intimate and
co-operative as possible, so that the children may get the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>group feeling and become accustomed to act in view of
group purposes and ideals. Their training should come
through service, self-respect, and example, with as little
coercion as possible. In the schools, of all grades, control
through self-government and public opinion will
probably more and more take the place of mechanism
and punishment, and the same plan will be applied to
corrective institutions. In the field of play spontaneous
groups under wholesome influences—boys’ and girls’ clubs,
Boy Scouts, and the like—are capable of an extension
which shall bring the whole youth of the land under the
sway of their admirable discipline. And so in colleges;
it seems to me that we can better get what we want, in
the way of health, bearing, self-control, and capacity to
meet military and other requirements, if we work mainly
through influence, example, and voluntary forms of organization.
Except in times of urgent crisis the sentiment
of students will resent compulsion and render it
more or less ineffective.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is the same in public life, in economic relations, and
in every kind of organization. We shall, in general, get
a better discipline by trusting democracy more rather than
less, provided this trust is not merely passive but includes
a vigorous use of educative methods. Even now, if the
test of discipline is self-control, and the power to function
responsibly in behalf of any purpose the group may adopt,
I question whether we have not shown ourselves as well
disciplined as any people. In so far as we have honestly
and thoroughly applied the democratic idea it has not
failed us.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XV<br> <span class='c011'>AN ORGANIC VIEW OF DEGENERATION</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>THE MEANING OF DEGENERATION—DOWNWARD GROWTH—AN ORGANIC
PROCESS—ORGANIC RESPONSIBILITY—PARTICULARISM
IN SOCIAL REFORM—NARROW VIEWS OF CAUSATION—THE
ONE-CAUSE FALLACY—STATISTICAL ILLUSION—LIMITATIONS OF
THE STATISTICAL METHOD—STUDIES OF DEGENERATE EVOLUTION</p>

<p class='c010'>The words degeneracy and degeneration are rooted
in the Latin word <i><span lang="la">genus</span></i>, and carry the idea of falling
away from a type or standard; as when, for example,
we say that a child is degenerate, meaning that he does
not come up to the standard set by his ancestors. They
are coming to be used as general terms for a state or process
of deterioration, most of the words in more common
use, such as wrong, evil, disease, and sin, having special
implications which it is desirable to avoid.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is the nature of the human mind, working through
social organization, to form norms or standards in every
department of life, and to stigmatize whatever falls below
these. Such norms are applied with peculiar emphasis
to human personality itself, and to the various
kinds of behavior in which it is expressed, because these
are the matters in which we are most interested. Whether
our judgments will prove to be permanently right or only
a kind of moral fashion, it is impossible to be sure. It
seems to be understood, however, that the word degeneration
is used only with reference to standards which are
believed to be of a relatively permanent or well-grounded
kind, so that it is hard to imagine that the implied judgment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>could be wholly reversed. A man would hardly
be called degenerate for dressing in the fashion of ten
years ago, however absurd he might appear; but feeble-mindedness,
disloyalty, cruelty, irresponsibility, or gross
dissipation might be so called, since it would seem that
these must always be detrimental to the common life.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is useful to distinguish between definite and indefinite
degeneracy, the former being such as is ascertainable in
some recognized way, as by medical examination or legal
process—for example, idiocy, crime, and alcoholism. The
indefinite sort, such as dishonesty, selfishness, instability
of character, and sensuality—of kinds within the law—may
be strongly condemned although not ascertainable
in the same way. Indeed this latter may well be the
more harmful, because it is less stigmatized and isolated,
more likely to mingle in the social current and exert a
pernicious influence. A feeble-minded person who is
legally recognized as such and put in a special institution
is harmless compared with one not so recognized
who remains in the world to demoralize others and breed
a family of incompetent children; and in like manner
the out-and-out housebreakers and assassins do far less
harm than the men of ability and influence whose deeds
are no better but who are clever enough to escape a
definite stigma.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is natural that under certain conditions growth should
be downward rather than upward. For the most part our
natural tendencies are morally indeterminate, not tendencies
to do good things or bad things, but to strive for
life and self-expression under the conditions which are
offered to us by the environment. These conditions may
be such as to appeal mainly to the lower trend and offer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>little or no stimulus to the higher. Many children are
depraved by sensual vices at an age when they have
practically no power to refuse them. Or intellect and ambition
may be aroused but led to work in directions opposed
to the standards of society. Studies of juvenile
delinquents have shown how their life is often such as to
train good faculties in bad directions. Thus a boy may
have a father so unjust that the boy feels justified in resisting
and deceiving him. A little later a badly conducted
school may make it natural for him to transfer this attitude
to his teachers, and so continue to develop a spirit
of resistance to authority. At the same time he not improbably
finds that his natural intimates, the boys of the
neighborhood, are banded together to thwart the police,
who, at the bidding of a municipality which has provided
no other playground, are repressing games on the street;
and if he can help his fellows in this they will make him
a leader. Thus the best traits of human nature, ambition,
fellowship, self-expression, combine to urge him into
what may presently turn out to be a career of crime.</p>

<p class='c013'>In general our principles of selective growth and organization,
while they are on the whole upbuilding and
progressive, may easily work in an opposite sense. The
current as a whole sets onward, but there are many eddies
and stagnant places. And if a retrogressive movement is
well developed and organized it has the same power as
any other to force individuals and lesser movements to
adapt themselves to it.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is not necessary that an environment, in order to
have a bad influence on a person, should be bad when
considered by itself. It is rather a matter of the kind of
interaction that takes place, and just as two persons,
neither of whom is bad in himself, may have the worst
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>influence on each other, so what would be called a good
environment and a good individual may make an unfortunate
combination. A carefully brought-up boy sometimes
goes wrong at the university because he has not
developed self-control enough to make a good use of his
freedom; or a man may be driven to drink and despair
by getting into an occupation which to another would be
quite congenial.</p>

<p class='c010'>Degeneration, then, is part of the general organic
process of life. Every wrong has a history, both in the
innate tendencies of individuals and in the circumstances
under which they have developed. We no longer feel
that we understand crime and vice when we know who are
practising them, and how, but we must trace them back
to bad homes and neighborhoods, want of wholesome play,
inadequate education, and lack of training for useful work.
And we need to know also, if we can, what kind of a
hereditary outfit each person brought into the world with
him, and how it has reacted to his surroundings.</p>

<p class='c013'>Moreover, the various kinds of wrong hang together in
an organic whole; they are due largely to the same causes
and each tends to reinforce all the others. Where poverty
and apathy have become established we may expect to
find drunkenness and other sensual vices, idiocy, insanity,
pauperism, and delinquency.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is no better illustration of this than the degenerate
villages that may be found, probably, in all parts
of the country, but are most common, perhaps, in regions
which have been stranded outside the current of economic
progress. In these the hereditary stock is usually
impaired by the more enterprising people moving
away, and also by the interbreeding of the inferior strains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>that remain. Along with this goes a deterioration of the
environment in the form of decay of enterprise, of wholesome
public opinion, of health, decency, and morality.
Drink, gambling, and prostitution flourish; whatever
decent people are left tend to move out, and not uncommonly
their places are taken by newcomers of a degraded
class who find it easier to get a footing in a place
like this than anywhere else. There may be another
village five miles away that is in just the opposite condition,
the only explanation of the difference being that
in the former degeneracy in some way got started and a
downward growth set in, while in the latter growth was
the other way.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the same way all real reform must be general, an
advance all along the line. Each particular evil is interwoven
with others and with the general process of life
in such a way that if you treat it as a thing by itself your
work will be superficial and usually ineffective. The
method of reform that naturally follows from the organic
view is one of team-work, under which each reformer
devotes himself to a special line of effort, but always in
co-operation with others working in different lines, and
always with an eye to the unity of the process in which
all are engaged. If one were to undertake the regeneration
of such a village as I have described, he would no doubt
have to begin at some definite point—with improvement
in the school, say, or the church, or the introduction of a
new industry—but he would need also to start work at
as many other points as possible.</p>

<p class='c013'>For similar reasons reform must be sympathetic, in the
sense that it must be based on a real understanding, an
inside view, of the minds of the people concerned. No
social situation is understood until we can see truly how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>the several parties think and feel at critical moments, and
see also something of the process by which they come to
think and feel in this way. In these states of the spirit
we get the vital synthesis of the various factors that have
been at work, the actual process of life here and now. If
we have this basis we may hopefully take the next step
of imagining something that will help the process on.
Of social workers without imagination it may be said,
as has been said of mediocre poets, that neither men nor
gods have any use for them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Much breath is wasted in discussing the question
whether society or the individual is to be held responsible
for social wrong. To clear thinking no such problem exists.
That is, so far as responsibility exists, it is both
social and individual, these terms merely indicating points
of view. The active individual is responsible, and yet he
only sums up the action of society at the given moment.
On the other hand, society, which has provided the antecedents
of the wrong, is responsible, but this only means
a large number of individuals. If Sam Clarke grows up
a criminal, and you say society is responsible, you mean
that you, I, and others who might, among us, have provided
better influences for him, failed to do so. And,
after all, Clarke himself has his individual responsibility
for what he does, like the rest of us. The essential change
which the organic view calls for is that we should see all
these individual responsibilities not as separable things,
but as working together in one living whole.</p>

<p class='c013'>Questions involving personal responsibility can always
be treated so as to make it appear that this is the main
factor, or, on the other hand, that the individual is dominated
by impersonal causes. If, for example, we study
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>unemployment with reference to the fluctuating character
of industry, the lack of rational adjustment between demand
and supply, and the inadequacy of vocational education
and guidance, we shall come to see it as a societal
condition over which the individual has little or no control;
but if we take statistics of unemployment with reference
to steadiness, foresight, ambition, and thrift, we may
find that the unemployed largely lack these traits. The
two sets of facts are not contradictory; it is merely a
matter of emphasizing one aspect or another of the same
organic condition. Unemployment goes up and down
with general conditions, but also selects the less competent.</p>

<p class='c013'>Common sense usually recognizes, in practical matters,
this many-sidedness of responsibility. If a boy has done
wrong we usually insist, in talking to him, that his will
is the cause, because we feel that this point of view ought
to be impressed upon him. But in speaking to his parents
we probably dwell upon their part in the matter,
and exhibit the boy as an almost passive agent. And
again, when we come to address the Civic Association
upon juvenile delinquency, we shall take both the boy
and his parents for granted, treating the whole matter
as mainly one of better schools and playgrounds. This
is a legitimate variation of emphasis quite in accord with
the organic view.</p>

<p class='c013'>I should say that under this view responsibility is not
so much diminished or increased as reinterpreted and
made a different kind of a thing; you have to think of
the whole question in a new way, which is not less hopeful
or animating than the old and much more in accord
with the facts of life. Responsibility becomes a universal
and interdependent function of mankind, in which each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>individual and group has its own part to play, and must
go ahead with this part, trusting that others will do the
like. The whole matter must be conceived in a spirit of
fellowship.</p>

<p class='c013'>We may blame and even punish other people; but it
must be done, if it is done rightly, with a kind of contrition,
and a sense that we more or less share their guilt,
somewhat in the spirit of a good father punishing his
child. Treatment which involves the isolation or repudiation
of any individual, no matter how degenerate, can
never stand as right. We are all in one boat. Imprisonment,
and perhaps even death, may be inflicted in a way
which carries an acknowledgment of social membership,
and makes it a kind of service.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is well to emphasize this co-operative idea, because
the minds of those engaged in reform have in the past
been much ruled by the opposite view, which I call particularism,
the view that there is some one reform which
is <em>the</em> fundamental one, and that if we give our whole energy
to effecting this the others will follow as a matter of
course. As each group of reformers has a different conception
as to what this fundamental reform is, the natural
result is a number of groups working at cross-purposes,
and each depreciating the others. Thus temperance reformers,
of the old pattern, held that the radical ill was
drink, and that when they had put an end to that, which
they sought to do by the most obvious and repressive
methods, there would be little else left to do. Others
thought that the unjust distribution of wealth was the
root of evil, seeking to remedy this by socialism or communism
of some kind and depreciating other reforms as
merely palliative. Another group, with biological antecedents,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>saw in bad heredity the primal ill, and advocated
sterilization. Still others pinned their faith to religious
conversion, woman suffrage, or the single tax. Reformers,
in short, went to battle like one of the hordes of our
Germanic forefathers, in small units, by tribes and clans,
each leader with a band of followers about him as ready
to fight their neighbors as the enemy, in a tumultuous,
loosely co-ordinated crowd, and not at all with the ordered
efficiency of a modern army.</p>

<p class='c013'>It may be thought that narrowness of view is, after all,
useful, because a man who believes that a particular thing
is the only thing worth doing is likely to pursue that with
more energy than if he took a broader view. The fact,
however, is that people who see only one thing can never
see that truly, and are not likely to act wisely with reference
to it. The truth of a matter lies in its relations to a
hundred other matters, and these are just what the particularist
does not perceive. Specialized effort is essential;
it is a good thing that each reformer should devote
himself with particular zeal to the cause which appeals
to him; but it should start from a large understanding of
the situation, and should proceed in a spirit of co-operation
with others.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is from a kind of particularism that when anything
is wrong we assume there must be some one cause to which
the whole or a definite part of the trouble can be ascribed.
Thus we say that twenty-five per cent of poverty is due
to drink, or sixty per cent of insanity to heredity; and if
these figures are, possibly, not quite correct, we do not
doubt that by more exact study we could find figures,
equally definite, that are correct. We do not see that
there is no such separation of factors as these calculations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>imply, and that instead of contributing to precision of
thought they impair it by introducing a false conception.</p>

<p class='c013'>In social inquiries we are not dealing, usually, with
distinct and separately measurable forces, but with a
complex of forces no one of which can be understood or
measured apart from the rest. Granting that drinking
to excess is present in one-fourth the cases of poverty,
other conditions will be present along with it, such as
ill health, bad housing, lack of training, lack of enterprise,
low wages, unwholesome work, and so on; and who
shall define what part each of these plays, and how far
drink is an effect rather than a cause? For the most
part poverty is the outcome of a complex organic development,
in the individual, his family, and his general
environment.</p>

<p class='c013'>Or suppose that we are investigating the causes of insanity
and find that the ancestry show traces of it in sixty
per cent of the cases. Who can say in how many cases
ancestral weakness would not have manifested itself without
the co-operation of such other factors as alcohol,
drugs, venereal disease, or nervous strain? Evidently to
ascribe sixty per cent to heredity alone would be misleading,
and no real understanding of the case is possible
without a synthetic study of all the chief factors.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such questions are the same, in principle, as the question
of the cause of the great European War. A dozen
causes may be given—as the military traditions and
ideals of Prussia, the commercial ambitions of Germany
and England, the lack of international control, the grudge
of the French regarding Alsace-Lorraine, the struggle between
democracy and autocracy, secret diplomacy, the
Eastern Question—all of them essential aspects of a vast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>and complex situation which, <em>as a whole</em>, was the real
source of the outbreak.</p>

<p class='c010'>This fallacy of “the cause” is so wide-spread and so insidious
that it may be worth while to consider somewhat
further the theory of the matter. Everything in life is
dependent upon a complex system of antecedents without
which it could not have come to pass; and yet it may
often be proper, from a practical standpoint, to speak of
“the cause” of an event. Commonly we mean by this
the exceptional or variant factor in the course of things.
There is a sound and regular process of some sort which
is broken in upon by something irregular and abnormal,
as when a man of habitually vigorous health is seized
with weakness and chills which prove to be due to an
irruption of the germs of typhoid fever. Something analogous
is often found in social process, as when poverty
and a sequence of other ills are brought upon a normal
family by a quite exceptional event, like the failure of a
bank, or an unforeseeable accident, and it is right to speak
of this as “the cause.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Another example is where there is one and only one
factor that we can control, and so interest centres upon
this, and we regard it as “the cause” of things going one
way or another. Thus, if a baby is sick and needs a
certain kind of food we may say that the getting or not
getting this food is the cause of its living or dying, although
its natural vitality, its previous nurture, the character of
the disease, and many other conditions enter. This
might plausibly be given as a reason for ascribing drunkenness
to the saloon; that is, it might be said that the
other causes, such as moral weakness, discouragement,
lack of better recreation, and the like, were obscure and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>hard to get at, while the saloon is something that we can
abolish.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now what I wish to say is that personal and social degeneration
is not ordinarily due to a wholly exceptional
factor breaking in upon a sound process, nor is it often
the case that all the factors but one are beyond our reach.
Usually many conditions of a more or less unwholesome
tendency co-operate, and usually all of these are directly
or indirectly within our power to amend. The social
process has a degenerate side that is an organic part of
it, and tends to break out wherever the better influences
are relaxed; and it has also a constructive energy that
may be applied wherever we see fit. The man who takes
to drink is never morally and physically sound, and it is
within our power not only to abolish the saloon but to
work upon the economic misery, the bad heredity, and
other factors that are of equal importance. To attack
one of these conditions and not the others might result
in a measure of success, but it would be like the success
an army may gain by piercing the enemy’s line at only
one point; an attempt to advance farther at this point
would be exposed to flank attacks by the enemy on each
side. If we repress degenerate factors at but one point they
are pretty sure to appear at others, and the only hope of
permanent conquest lies in an advance all along the line.</p>

<p class='c013'>Recently the people of a neighboring city became
alarmed at the growth of juvenile crime, and a leading
social worker did me the honor to ask my opinion about
the matter. He said that the chief of police laid it to idleness;
Father L. of the Catholic Charities to unsupervised
recreation; Mr. M. of the Boy Scouts to lack of recreation
facilities, and Mr. E. of the Boys’ Farm to wrong
conditions in the home.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>It seemed to me probable that all these conditions and
others also had a part in the trouble, and I suggested that
a fundamental way to study the question would be to
take, say, a hundred typical cases of boys coming before
the courts, and have social workers, by gaining their
confidence, make an intimate study of their life-histories,
trying to see just how the conditions of the city had acted
upon their development, and where and why they had
gone wrong. The cases would doubtless differ much
from one another, and all together would be likely to indicate
a whole system of improvements tending to make
the community a better place for boys to grow up in.
Nothing adequate would be accomplished by working
upon any one cause.</p>

<p class='c013'>I hold, then, that in all studies of degeneracy aiming to
be thorough and suggest thorough remedies, <em>the conception
of “the cause” should give way to that of organic development</em>.
Even accidents, viewed largely, are not isolated
causes but the outcome of events which we can understand
and control.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is easy for a person with a particular bias regarding
causes of degeneration to present statistics which seem to
confirm his view: he has only to display the facts in such
a manner as to reveal the operation of the cause in which
he is interested, unconsciously concealing the truth that
others are equally operative. If he is a student of heredity
he will so present matters—and quite honestly, too—that
you will wonder you ever thought anything else of
much importance; but the next man, armed with facts
just as cogent, will give you the same impression regarding
education. I suppose there is nothing which more
confuses and discourages the amateur student of society
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>than this illusive and contradictory character in what
seem to be, and often are, quite trustworthy facts. Unless
he can get a commanding and reconciling view, his case,
as a thinker, is hopeless.</p>

<p class='c013'>The practical truth, in all such cases, is that what we
are to regard as the cause, if we are to single out any
one, is not an absolute matter but relative to the special
situation we have to meet. We are justified in selecting
any factor which we may hope to control and thus bring
about improvement, as the cause for the purpose in hand.
If we are discussing eugenic marriage it may be quite
proper to say that non-eugenic marriages are the cause
of sixty per cent of insanity, provided we can show a
probability that this per cent might be eliminated through
the control of marriage. At the same time it might be
true that sixty per cent could be eliminated by abolishing
alcohol and venereal disease, and, again, that sixty
per cent might be saved through better education and
training—notwithstanding the fact that these three sixties
added together are more than the total number of
cases. To a great extent these are alternative methods
of treatment, any one of which might be effective. It is
on the same principle that a man who is suffering from
illness brought on by heavy eating, lack of exercise, and
hereditary weakness of the digestive organs, might be
cured either by less food or more exercise, or, if it were
practicable, by getting a better hereditary outfit.</p>

<p class='c010'>I do not mean to depreciate the statistical study of
degeneracy, believing it to be of the utmost value, but
its legitimate purpose I take to be to contribute authentic
details which the mind can use, along with other facts,
to help in forming a true picture of the social process
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>leading up to the condition we are interested in. The
particular facts and relations we get in this way are like
the detailed studies a landscape-painter makes of trunks
of trees, leaves, rocks, and water surfaces, which cannot
be put directly into his painting, but which give him a
perception of details by the aid of which his constructive
vision can produce the whole which he strives to depict.
The understanding of a social situation is always such a
creative or artistic working of the mind and never a reproduction
of statistics as such. I have before me the report
of an investigation of the feeble-minded in a certain
State, which contains carefully prepared tables and diagrams
showing the number and grade of the mentally
defective, their sex, age, nativity, ancestry, school progress,
delinquency, physical condition, and many other pertinent
facts. Such a report is of great value to a capable
mind which already has a sound general understanding
of the subject, and of its relation to other subjects, but in
the lack of these it is of little or no use; it is a raw material
which needs a trained imagination to give it form
and meaning. If there is any kind of knowledge for
which a highly specialized action of the mind suffices,
it is not sociology, which always calls for a large synthesis
of life.</p>

<p class='c013'>I think I do not go too far in saying that most current
interpretation of statistics is invalidated by inadequate
views of the social process as a whole. There
is evident need, in practical work, of clearer views of
one’s field and of its relation to other fields. The
common complaint is of well-intentioned societies and
institutions working ahead in a narrow and somewhat
futile way for lack of ideas and methods broad as the
facts themselves and adequate to effect co-operation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Sometimes vast quantities of precise data are available
which illuminate nothing for lack of organizing conceptions.
The social process itself being organic, social
knowledge must become so in order to deal with it.</p>

<p class='c010'>If we aim at an understanding of any extended condition
of degeneracy, such as the prevalence of crime, vice,
and misery in a group, there is nothing adequate, I think,
except a precise, sympathetic, and many-sided study of
the evolution of the condition, both in individuals and in
the group as a whole. <em>All</em> the main factors must be gone
into, both in detail and in synthesis. For example, a
survey might be made of a degenerate village, or quarter
of a city, which should not only describe the actual condition
from various points of view, but should trace its
history in the same way. And it would not be complete
without a collection of typical individual biographies.
These should be sympathetic, and should enable us really
to understand, in a human way, the course of personal
life in its representative varieties. There is much of a
kind of formalism which shuns the merely human as sentimental
and prefers to rest in the external fact, not seeing
that this is always barren without a human interpretation.
We are far too complaisant, in my opinion, to that
prejudice of the physical scientist which identifies the
personal with the vague, and wishes to have as little to
do with it as possible. Even psychologists are sometimes
guilty of this, which for them is a kind of treason.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XVI<br> <span class='c011'>DEGENERATION AND WILL</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>THE WILL MAY BE DEGENERATE—A COMMON-SENSE VIEW OF FREEDOM—BELIEF
IN ABSOLUTE FREEDOM NOT BENEFICIAL—EXPERIENCE
MAY BREAK DOWN THE WILL—IS TEMPTATION GOOD FOR US?—DEGENERACY
IS BASED ON NORMAL IMPULSES—“NATURAL DEPRAVITY”—THE
CONSTRUCTIVE METHOD IN REFORM</p>

<p class='c010'>The human will, I take it, is no separate faculty, but
the whole mind functioning as a guide to action, its power
being shown in grasping the material which life offers and
moulding it to rational ends. A person with a vigorous
will shows an onward growth which is in great measure
foreseen and intentional; he forms ideals and strives to
realize them. It does not follow, however, that this
striving is in a right direction. The will, like every form
of life, is tentative and may take a degenerate course,
that is, a course which the better moral judgment will
declare to be wrong. As we see will actually working,
in individuals, in nations, or in what form you please,
it is a creative power, to be sure, but uncertainly guided,
feeling its way and liable to err. We know that a boy
may devote really first-rate powers to the leadership of
a pernicious gang, or a nation devote an admirable organization
to an unjust war.</p>

<p class='c013'>We may, from this point of view, distinguish two types
of degeneracy, one a strong type, in which the will is
vigorous, but at variance with higher social standards,
and a weak type, in which it is ineffectual, though possibly
directed toward the good. With the latter we are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>all familiar, and it is perhaps more common than the
other. Most of us who fail to help the world along do
so not because we do not mean well, but because we lack
force and persistency in well-doing.</p>

<p class='c010'>As to freedom, I may say at once that I am no mechanist
or predestinationist, but believe that the human will,
individual and collective, an organic whole of onward
life, is a true creative process, whose working may perhaps
be anticipated by the imagination, which shares in
its creative nature, but not by mere calculation. I do
not care, however, to discuss the metaphysics of the
matter, but would wish to present it in a common-sense
way which would appeal to every one’s observation.</p>

<p class='c013'>If we consider fairly the question of what the will can
actually do we see that its strength, whatever our philosophy
of it may be, is in fact limited—though we cannot
exactly define the limits—and is greater or smaller according
to our native force and the influences that help or
hinder us. Our freedom is not a power to escape from
our history and environment, but something that works
along with these, enabling us to do things original but
not discontinuous. While I believe that the human spirit
is part of a creative onward whole, building up life to
unknown issues, I believe also that the growth of this
whole is gradual and connected.</p>

<p class='c013'>The matter is not at all mysterious when you consider
it in practice. Is a man, for example, free to paint a
good picture? We know that if he has good natural gifts
and lively ambition, has been trained in a good school
and inspired by great examples, he stands a good chance
to do so; but that if nature or circumstance has denied
him any of these essentials he stands little or no chance.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>History shows that good pictures are never painted except
when certain conditions concur. There is nothing
mystical about freedom in this case; it is just every-day
life.</p>

<p class='c013'>The same principle applies to moral achievement. If
we have a man of natural energy and breadth of human
sympathy whose experience has afforded him noble suggestions
and examples, we need not be astonished at some
exalted action; and if we know him intimately enough we
shall be able to trace some history of this action in his
previous conduct. But if he was born feeble-minded he
cannot have large conceptions, and if his associates have
been wholly depraved—supposing that possible—his conduct
will share this depravity.</p>

<p class='c013'>Free will, if you call it that, is then simply a power of
creative growth, which we all have in some degree, and
starts from our actual situation. No one is free to do
anything he has not worked up to.</p>

<p class='c010'>I hold, for many reasons, that it is a bad thing to teach
absolute freedom of the will, as bad as to teach fatalism.
It leads to discouraging judgments of conduct, both our
own and that of others, and to a neglect of the training
process by which everything good must be prepared.
The logical outcome of the doctrine of unlimited freedom
would seem to be that one should make a great effort to
achieve at once what he wants, without regard to his
preparation. The logical outcome of the view I suggest
is that one sets about moulding his whole life into a
process from which success will naturally flow. No
thoughtful observer will doubt which is the better method.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is an open secret, which few seem willing to utter,
that ardent spirits often make too much effort, exhausting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>and disheartening themselves by attempting the impossible.
I know a man of eager temperament and
rather slender physique who, on asking himself what was
the most serious and pervading mistake of his early life,
finds the answer to be “I tried too hard.” The prevalence
of the idea of unconditional freedom works to the
advantage of phlegmatic people, who cannot be harmed
by it, and to the prejudice of the more impressible.</p>

<p class='c013'>The author of an article on The Handicapped, by One
of Them, says: “It was my own fate to be just strong
enough to play about with the other boys, and attempt
all their games and ‘stunts,’ without being strong enough
actually to succeed in any of them. It never used to
occur to me that my failure and lack of skill were due to
circumstances beyond my control, but I would always
impute them, in consequence of my rigid Calvinistic
bringing-up, I suppose, to some moral weakness of my own.
I never resigned myself to the inevitable, but over-exerted
myself constantly in a grim determination to succeed....
I simply tantalized myself, and grew up with a deepening
sense of failure.”<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c014'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The strongest men, I should say, usually understand
that their strength is limited, and husband it accordingly,
taking care to keep a reserve force, the mere appearance
and consciousness of which win most of their victories.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is a fact of observation that social experience may be
such as to break down strength of will. A large part of
it is confidence, and this comes from the habit of success.
A healthy will, if it tries and fails, will try again, perhaps
try harder. No one can say how many trials will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>made, but it is certain that one cannot go on indefinitely
putting forth his full strength in the face of uniform
failure. A man may try a dozen times to scramble over
an eight-foot board fence; but if it proves too much for
him he will presently cease his efforts and avoid such
fences in the future. The process known as “losing your
grip” is primarily a loss of self-respect and self-confidence
due to a series of failures. Imagined loss of the respect
of others enters largely into it, and it is hastened by the
inability to dress well and to keep clean, also by poor
food, anxiety, loss of sleep, and physical deterioration.
Sensual excitement is sought as a relief, and often completes
the ruin. Any candid man must, I think, admit
that it is easy to imagine a course of experience which
would leave him as completely “down and out” as any
tramp. The habit of accomplishment and that alone
gives self-respect, hope, and courage to face the eyes of
men. The disheartened man is no man, and if kept disheartened
for a long enough time he is matter for the
scrap-heap. The healthy growth of the will requires
difficulty, to be sure, and even failure, but only such
failure and difficulty as can be and are overcome in a
sufficient proportion of cases to keep confidence alive.
The power to resist a given temptation is no more absolute
than the power to swim a mile; one can do it if his
previous life has been such as to train his strength to the
requisite point; otherwise not. It is as certain in the
one case as in the other that many simply cannot do it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Each of us, I suppose, knows that he has weaknesses
that his will has been unable to overcome, that he has
had times of defeat when the assailing forces, if persistent,
would have crushed his character, that he has had friends,
no worse than himself, whose characters have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>crushed. We had better, then, say nothing of the unlimited
power of the human will, but ascribe our escape
to a preponderance of favoring conditions.</p>

<p class='c013'>It seems strange, when you think of it, that we have
pity and hospitals for the sick in body, but for sick spirits—often
a more deadly illness—we have no hospitals (except
for the insane), few skilled physicians, and very little
understanding. I suppose it is because this kind of
trouble is not tangible enough to impress itself upon us,
and also because we shun the effort of the imagination
that would be required to understand it. Here, certainly,
is a field for “social work.”</p>

<p class='c010'>One often encounters the doctrine that reforms are
useless and even harmful, because temptation alone can
strengthen the will, as when Sir Thomas Browne says
that “They that endeavor to abolish Vice destroy also
Virtue; for contraries, although they destroy one another,
are yet the life of one another.” The argument is constantly
used against the restriction of prostitution and
the liquor traffic.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now, it is true that the will grows by exercise. Life is
ever a struggle, a struggle, moreover, in which there must
always, probably, be more or less failure. We may agree
with Milton when he says, advocating the knowledge of
evil: “I cannot praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue, unexercised
and unbreathed, that never sallies out and seeks
her adversary, but slinks out of the race where that immortal
garland is to be run for, not without dust and
heat.”<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c014'><sup>[39]</sup></a> But what is commonly overlooked is that, since
this is an onward world, the struggle ought to keep rising
to higher levels, and that unnecessary struggle is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>mere waste and dissipation. We do not need to preserve
evil, as the English preserve foxes, for the exercise
of hunting it. And yet poverty, disease and vice
are frequently upheld on this ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is no danger that struggle will disappear, so long
as human energy remains: if it is no longer against drink
or licentiousness or war, it can go on to something higher.
Every temptation is a conflict, and if it is not a necessary
conflict it is a waste of strength: to contend over and
over again with the <em>same</em> temptation is a sign of arrested
development. Solicitation merely defiles the mind, and a
community which tolerates preventable vice wrongs itself
in the same way as a man who reads a salacious book.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is, no doubt, this much in the argument for undergoing
temptation, that if the general conditions are
such that one is almost sure to be exposed to it sooner or
later, it is well to be armed against it by previous knowledge
and discipline. Thus the best preventives of licentiousness
are probably a wholesome social intercourse
between boys and girls from childhood, and a knowledge
of and respect for the higher functions of sex. But even
here “sex-teaching” may easily be pernicious.</p>

<p class='c010'>Degeneration does not spring from a special part of
human nature, but is based on normal impulses, which
take a higher or lower direction according as they are
guided. Our native traits are for the most part vague
capacities which are morally indeterminate at the outset
of life, and out of which, for better or worse, the most
various kinds of behavior may grow. We know, for example,
that the sexual impulses are back of the family,
and of all the good which the family at its best brings
with it; many psychologists, moreover, believe that these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>instincts, contained and transformed, are the prime
movers of nearly all our higher life, of love, art, religion,
and social aspiration. But if we pervert or waste this
energy it engenders the foulest things we know, sensualism,
prostitution, loathsome diseases, spiritual corruption,
and despair.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the same way the need of excitement, relaxation, and
change is ever impelling us to new things, but whether to
literature, art, and wholesome sport, or to gambling,
drink, and degrading shows, is largely a matter of opportunity
and education. The mere need of companionship,
the very element in which human nature lives, co-operates
with a bad environment to entice us into all kinds
of evil courses. The boy is bound to join a gang of some
sort, and if the gangs in his neighborhood are vicious and
criminal the outlook for him is bad; while a girl who has
no better kind of society will be likely to frequent questionable
dance-halls and accept automobile rides with
strange men.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is, in fact, a certain practical truth in the idea
of the “natural depravity” of human nature. That is
to say, the higher life of the human mind is co-operative,
is reached and sustained only through the higher sort of
social organization; and, in the absence of this, human
nature, thrown back upon crude impulse, falls into sensualism
and disorder. Lust, violence, greed, crude generosity,
are natural in a sense that self-control, consideration
for others and observance of moral standards are
not so; they spring more immediately from primitive
emotions, and require no higher thought and discipline.
In other words, righteousness, in every form, is the difficult
achievement of the social whole when working at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>its best, and is impaired whenever this is impaired. A
good soldier can exist only as part of a good army, and a
good Christian can exist only as a member of a Christian
community, visible or invisible.</p>

<p class='c013'>How will a man’s mind work when he is released from
the higher incentives of society, from public ambitions,
inspiring literature, the oversight of opinion, the expectation
of friends and the control of law? Except in so
far as he can carry these with him in his imagination he
must fall back upon unschooled impulses, such as those
of sex, of appetite for food and drink, of a crude sociability
and craving for excitement. We see how this works
in frontier towns and in the confused populations of our
cities; and any one who leaves the restraints of home to
live among strangers is likely to feel a kind of irresponsibility
and moral decay setting in. Without the support
of a moral order the individual degenerates.</p>

<p class='c010'>The great thing, then, if we aim to combat degeneracy
in a large way, is to build up an affirmative, constructive,
many-sided community life, that can draw the individual
into its own current, and evoke his higher possibilities.
Any one who will look about him may see unnumbered
examples of the waste of human nature in our
disorderly civilization, the gross and futile expense of
energies out of which a little leadership and discipline
might make the best things of life. We find prosperous
country towns, with almost no poverty, where the younger
people are given over to sexual and other vices, chiefly
because no organizing spirit has provided a higher outlet
for their energies. The prevalent feeling, as expressed
in a student’s account, is, “Good Lord, I wish we could
scare up something to do,” and if the Lord does not answer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>a prayer of this kind we know who does. In another
town where factory girls get high wages, they buy
twenty-dollar hats and silk hose, and have a reputation for
being “tough.” I knew of two boys, aged about seventeen,
who started out with the manly purpose of sampling
all the kinds of intoxicating drinks that were sold in town.
They were good boys, and this seemed to them a high
adventure. Many boys enter houses of prostitution for
the first time in a similar spirit.</p>

<p class='c013'>A student who had helped conduct a boys’ club in a
neglected part of town made this answer to the question,
Why should the boys have grown worse without the
club? “We merely reply that our experience with boys
of this age in the environment these boys are in, near the
railroad and near the shops and factories, and near some
hell-hole saloons, tells us that the boys, if they had been
allowed to develop unguided, would have followed the
course of the boys of the generation next above them in
age, and formed into a semi-criminal gang, with no use
for school or order, and with a community of interest in
the lower forms of amusement.” Another student, who
had been a school-teacher in a lethargic and depraved
rural community, speaks of the surprising effect upon his
pupils of hearing “a talented soprano singer.” “You
could see their souls, purged of all their hopeless provincial
badness, shine in their faces.” Even in our colleges, notwithstanding
the social and athletic activities of which
we hear so much, there is a good deal of dissipation ascribable
to the fact that the need of companionship and self-expression,
among boys and girls cut off from former
associations, is after all very imperfectly met, and the
freshman hungering for these things is apt to find them
most accessible in degenerate groups.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Any individual is a place where lower and higher tendencies
are in conflict, and how the battle goes depends,
other things equal, on the vigor and insistence with which
the opposing suggestions are presented. If vice is organized,
urgent, skilfully advertised, while virtue is not,
it is certain that many balanced choices will swing the
wrong way.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>DISPLACEMENT—ITS DIVERSE EFFECTS—MIGRATION—CHANGES IN
THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM—IN BELIEFS AND STANDARDS—DEMORALIZATION
OF SAVAGE PEOPLES BY CONTACT WITH CIVILIZATION—STAGNATION—ORGANIZED
VICE</p>

<p class='c010'>Probably the phases of degeneration most distinctive
of our time are those connected with social change. We
live, as we constantly hear, in an epoch of transition, and
of the confusion and mental strain that go with such an
epoch. Although change may be progressive on the
whole, it is apt to break down established social relations
and with them the moral order and discipline upon which
the individual depends.</p>

<p class='c013'>We need to distinguish, in this connection, between
moderate change, which is usually wholesome, giving us
the stimulus needed to keep our minds awake, and radical
change, involving displacement. By this term I mean
such a break in the conditions of personal life that one
can scarcely adapt himself to them by any gradual and
normal process; there is a kind of shock which may easily
upset his character. We are dependent for moral health
upon intimate association with a group of some sort,
usually consisting of our family, neighbors, and other
friends. It is the interchange of ideas and feelings with
this group, and a constant sense of its opinions that makes
standards of right and wrong seem real to us. We may
not wholly adopt its judgments, or that of any member
of it, but the social interplay is necessary to keep the
higher processes of the mind in action at all.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>Now, it is the general effect of social displacement to
tear us away more or less completely, from such groups.
When we move to town, or go to another country, or get
into a different social class, or adopt ideas that alienate
us from our former associates, it is not at all certain that
we shall form new relations equally intimate and cogent
with the old. A common result, therefore, is a partial
moral isolation and atrophy of moral sense. If the
causes of change are at all general we may have great
populations made up largely of such displaced units, a
kind of “anarchy of spirits” among whom there is no
ethos or settled system of moral life at all, only a confused
outbreak of impulses, better or worse. Or the
prevalent beliefs may break down under the impact of
strange ideas, and with them may go the ideals, sanctions,
standards, which have heretofore lived in the minds of
men and sustained their daily striving. Whole communities
may thus be demoralized. Indeed mental strain enters
largely into all demoralization by change. The
adaptation of a social group to its conditions is normally
a matter of generations of experiment and adjustment.
It is too much to think out all at once, and no wonder
if untrained minds, confused and discouraged by attempting
to do so, give it up and live by impulse.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is probably the usual effect of displacement to both
intensify and disorganize the processes of selection;
there is a livelier conflict of persons and tendencies along
with a lack of established institutions to preside over this
conflict and regulate the outcome. The result, as regards
individuals, is likely to be a greater diversity in their
fortunes than could exist under more orderly conditions;
opportunity, of certain kinds at least, may be increased,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>and those who have capacities suited to take advantage
of it, or who happen to be in favorable situations, will
prosper; others, who might have done as well as any in
quieter times, will be crowded down. A chance mixture
of characters and temperaments, brought into contact
with a chance mixture of conditions and opportunities,
will naturally produce many new combinations, both
fortunate and unfortunate.</p>

<p class='c013'>The principle applies to moral as well as economic
struggles. The unregulated freedom of action, forcing
constant choice and self-reliance, develops the mind
rapidly, one way or the other, and is likely to produce
some characters of great vigor and independence, while
others, not necessarily of inferior capacity, may suffer
decay. Those who come out successfully may not be
the best but simply the toughest, the least sensitive and
vulnerable. Miss Addams writes: “A settlement constantly
sees the deterioration of highly educated foreigners
under the strain of maladjustment, in marked contrast
to the often rapid rise of the families of illiterate
immigrants.”<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c014'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In the international migrations of our day, which in
some years have brought more than a million strangers
to the harbors of the United States, the guiding motives
are mainly economic, and these also cause the immigrants
to congregate in certain localities after they arrive. It is
true that part of them come in families, and that people
from the same provinces and neighborhoods often settle
together; but the social displacement, along with the
total change in environment and modes of work, is sufficient
to cause wide-spread maladjustment and strain. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>has been said, with much appearance of truth, that it
would be easier for the immigrants to fight Indians, like
the first settlers, than to combat the perplexing social
and economic conditions of the present time. There is,
perhaps, no topic of the kind on which the evidence is
more profuse and unanimous than this of the moral
strain and partial degeneration of our foreign element.
It would be easy to collect any number of passages like
the following, from a settlement report:</p>

<p class='c017'>The rude reversal of relationships, when parents depend more
upon children as interpreters than children upon parents for guidance;
the separation of husband from wife, father from children,
for the first time, under the necessity to seek a seasonable job at
some lumber-camp, railway section or shipping route; the transplanting
of a peasant family from their out-of-door life and work
in a southern climate to the indoor life in a crowded city tenement,
and work in a sweat-shop or factory; the ignorance of and inability
to conform to the difference in laws, customs, climate, clothing, diet,
and housing—these and many other experiences combine to make
a situation pitifully tragic.<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c014'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The Jews, because of their excellent family life and
loyalty to their traditions, probably stand change as well
as any people; but they acknowledge a considerable
demoralization, and a writer in the Pittsburgh Survey
gives, as examples, wife desertion, laxity of religious observance,
gambling at the coffee-houses, occasional licentiousness,
and contempt for the ideals, customs, and
beauties of the traditional family and religious life. One
of my Jewish students writes: “I can take at random
twenty of my friends, and out of these twenty no more
than five, I can say, are really interested in Judaism.
Yet all of them are the sons of pious Jewish parents.”
The decay of respect and discipline on the part of children
is universally complained of, and unites with other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>demoralizing conditions to explain the prevalence of
juvenile crime.</p>

<p class='c013'>The movement from country to town is quite as trying,
especially as most of those who go are young men and
girls who separate entirely from their family and neighborhood
connections, becoming subject to unusual stress
and temptation without the usual safeguards of association
and public opinion. Lonesomeness drives them into
questionable companionship, and organized vice of several
kinds exists by exploiting them. It is well known that
urban prostitutes are recruited largely from girls who
have left country homes to work in the city.<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c014'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The radical changes in the economic system upset life
even for those who remain in the same place. It is rare
nowadays that people earn their bread in the same way
that their fathers did; they have to turn to new occupations,
form new habits and think new thoughts. Even
farming, the ancient type of stability, is rapidly being
transformed, and the farmer with it. Moreover, it often
happens that an occupation does not last a lifetime; and
one who has achieved efficiency and high pay in it feels
it drop from under him, leaving him to begin again as a
common laborer. This may happen several times to the
same man. To all this we must add the irregularity of
employment due to the ups and downs of modern industry
and to labor troubles, the result being a rather general
condition of insecurity and strain. Men and families
are thrown out of the system, others are disquieted by
apprehension, and nearly all feel that their houses are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>builded on the sand, so that they cannot easily have that
confidence in the stability of their livelihood upon which
mental and moral stability largely depend. The principle
that human character deteriorates under irregular and
uncertain employment is an old one and, I believe, undisputed.
There are innumerable cases like the following:
“When he moved to Peoria he had regular work for
some months, until a lull threw him out. Then he began
to loaf on the corner, and has never since desired anything
more. ‘It’s easy,’ he said, ‘and I get enough to live
on. If I get sick there’s the hospitals.’”  Where there is
a class of workers subject to such conditions, like the
lumberjacks and steamboat-hands of the Great Lakes, or
the wheat-harvesters of the Northwest, it is almost invariably
found that their lives are morally as well as industrially
irregular; and though this may be partly due
to the fact that such work attracts an unstable class of
men, there is no reasonable doubt that the work itself
causes instability.</p>

<p class='c013'>The unemployment due to hard times, a great strike,
or to other widely acting causes, seems invariably to lead
to an increase of vagrancy, dissipation and crime in the
class thus displaced. The panic of 1907 was followed in
1909 by an increase of over thirty-four per cent in the
commitments to Elmira Reformatory, most of whose
inmates come from New York and other industrial cities.<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c014'><sup>[43]</sup></a>
An access of prosperity may be equally demoralizing.
Those who have made money rapidly, whether they are
actually rich or only relatively so compared with former
straits, furnish a large amount of moral degeneracy.
Lacking ideals and traditions that would teach them the
better uses of their means, they are apt to spend them in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>display and sensual dissipation, and the most prosperous
towns and families are often the least edifying in their
behavior. A very thriving city in this neighborhood,
one that has grown rich by the sudden growth of a line
of manufacture, is credibly described as in a far worse
state of morals and culture than before the boom.
“Things move so fast that people become confused.
There are few standards, each gets what he can.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Our deeper beliefs have for their function a mental adjustment
to the ruling conditions of life. Where the conditions
are stable we gradually attain modes of thought
and action suitable to them, and are enabled to live with
some assurance. But if the conditions change rapidly
these modes of thought and action are discredited, because
they no longer “work,” and, since more suitable
modes cannot be achieved in a day, we fall into distraction,
infidelity, pessimism, and lax conduct. “Where
there is no vision the people perish.”</p>

<p class='c013'>No one doubts that this is a time of discredited beliefs
and standards. We have an industrial system which
calls for new conceptions of right and wrong and new
methods of impressing these upon men. Otherwise we
do not see what right and wrong are, and either plunge
into dangerous experiments or fall back upon a crude
selfishness. A few years ago the officials of one of the
great trade-unions, an intelligent body of men, embarked
upon a campaign of blowing up with dynamite the buildings
of those who opposed their commands. They had,
apparently, no clear sense that this was wrong, but had
accepted the plausible view that they were engaged in a
“war,” and that violent means were justifiable. A
thoughtful and dispassionate mind easily sees the fallacy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>of this, but men in difficult moral situations are seldom
thoughtful and dispassionate; they need to have the right
defined for them in habits and symbols; and our economic
life is filled with men going wrong for lack of such
definition. Where there is anarchy in thought there will
be anarchy in conduct.</p>

<p class='c013'>The same is true of the religious and moral institutions,
whose special function it is to give us a sound and stable
basis of conduct. Churches, creeds, standards, <em>mores</em>,
every form of established righteousness, have been shaken
and discredited by their apparent unsuitability, so that
a large part of mankind, tacitly if not openly, treat all
such institutions as obsolete, and tend to the view that
you may do anything you like unless you encounter something
strong enough to prevent it. However one may
trust in the power of human nature as a whole to weather
such a storm, it would be a foolish optimism to doubt
that large numbers will be lost in it. In fact we see on
every hand individuals, associations, schools of literature,
art, and philosophy, even mighty nations, struggling with
one another, and with their own thoughts in the endeavor
to work a moral whole out of this confusion.</p>

<p class='c010'>The principle of moral disintegration through abrupt
change is the same that acts so destructively in the contact
of savage and civilized life. Irrespective of any intentional
aggression, and in spite, sometimes, of a sincere
aim to do good, the mere contact of civilization with
the social system of more primitive peoples is, generally
speaking, destructive of the latter, and of the character
of the individuals involved in it. The white man, whether
he be soldier, settler, or missionary, brings with him overwhelming
evidences of superiority, in power, knowledge,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>and resources. He may mean well, but he always wants
his own way, and that way is inevitably that of the traditions,
ideals, and organization of the white race. As the
savage comes to feel this superiority his own institutions
are degraded in his eyes, and himself, also, as inseparable
from these institutions. Confused, displaced, helpless,
thrown back upon mere impulses without the dignity and
discipline of a corporate life, he falls into degeneration.
“It is really the great tragedy of civilization,” says Professor
Stunner, “that the contact of lower and higher is
disastrous to the former, no matter what may be the
point of contact, or how little the civilized may desire to
do harm.”<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c014'><sup>[44]</sup></a> Unbiassed observers are for the most part, I
think, of this opinion. Thus Spencer and Gillen, speaking
of the tribes of Central Australia, say that the white
man “introduces a disturbing element into the environment
of the native, and from that moment degeneration
sets in.”<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c014'><sup>[45]</sup></a> Old morals are lost and no new ones gained.
Dudley Kidd says of the Negroes of South Africa: “We
have undermined the clan system right and left, and have
riddled its defenses through and through with the explosive
shells of civilization; we have removed nearly all the
old restraints which curbed the people, and have disintegrated
their religion, and so rendered it, comparatively
speaking, useless.... With the clan system have gone,
or are going, some of the best traits in Kafir character.<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c014'><sup>[46]</sup></a>...
If we would but leave them alone they could easily
set up a civilization that would give them unbounded satisfaction.
But our industrial requirements, no less than
our moral impulses, make that solution of the difficulty
impossible.<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c014'><sup>[47]</sup></a>... We expose savages to the highly complex
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>stimuli of individualism, labor demands, economic
pressure, violent legal changes, trade, clothing, industries,
a lofty spiritual religion; and to all these we add a wholly
unsuitable system of book-learning....”<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c014'><sup>[48]</sup></a> There is a
discipline under the native system that is quite effective in
its way. “Obedience to parents hardly needs to be taught,
for the children notice how every one in the kraal is instinctively
obedient to the old men: the children catch
this spirit without knowing it.”<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c014'><sup>[49]</sup></a> This, of course, disappears
with the irruption of disorganizing ideas. Miss
Kingsley, speaking of the Negro tribes of the northwest
coast, says: “Nothing strikes one so much in studying
the degeneration of these native tribes as the direct effect
that civilization and reformation has in hastening it.”<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c014'><sup>[50]</sup></a>
And so Nansen tells of the degeneration of the Eskimo,
in his account of The First Crossing of Greenland. Their
food-supply has been reduced, their skill in seal-catching
lost, sickness increased by poverty and wearing clothes
indoors, a demoralizing taste for luxury aroused, and their
self-respect and social unity undermined. All this notwithstanding
that they have been extremely well treated
by the Danes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Even Christian missions have served as the involuntary
channel of disintegrating forces. Not to speak of
such crudities as compelling the native to wear clothes
under climatic and domestic conditions which make them
breeders of disease, the mere fact of discrediting rooted
beliefs and habits in order to substitute something unfamiliar
is almost inevitably destructive. Many individuals
may be really Christianized, wholly transplanted,
as it were, from one social system into another, while at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>the same time the overthrow of the native institutions
is causing another class, possibly much larger, to become
irresponsible and dissolute. The fact that white civilization
was introduced into the Hawaiian Islands under the
auspices of American missionaries of the highest character,
whose descendants are now the ruling class, has not prevented
the moral and physical decay of the native race.</p>

<p class='c013'>I should add, however, first, that missionaries have
latterly come to work in a more sociological spirit, and to
recognize the duty of treating native institutions with
respect, and, second, that contact with civilization is
inevitable, and the missionaries are commonly the class
who are working most sincerely to make this contact
as beneficial to the native, or as little injurious, as possible.
Without doubt the situation would be far worse
if they should withdraw their efforts.</p>

<p class='c013'>The great oriental nations which are now assimilating
the civilization of the West are protected from moral
dissolution by the strength of their institutions and the
loyalty with which they cherish them. In this way their
system of life, and the individuals who embody it, preserve
their continuity and self-respect; but even in China and
Japan the process is trying and, by all accounts, involves
a good deal of demoralization. It is the same story of
the discrediting of old ethics before the new has developed,
and of the spread of a somewhat licentious individualism.
In India also degeneracy is rife among the
numerous class who have broken away from the caste
organization, which, with whatever defects, is still a system
of moral control.</p>

<p class='c010'>Displacement by change is no more harmful than the
opposite extreme of stagnation. One whose higher faculties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>are not aroused by fresh situations and problems is
thrown back upon the lower. While American life is,
on the whole, remarkably active, its activity is not regularly
distributed, and is, moreover, mostly of a somewhat
narrow sort, lacking in richness and higher appeal, so
that it often fails to engage the real interest of the actor.
The result is that in the midst of our strenuous civilization
there is a large proportion of stagnant minds.</p>

<p class='c013'>Degenerate villages, such as I have mentioned in another
connection, are to be found, apparently, all over the
country, and I have notes of seven or eight, in Michigan
and neighboring States, that have been described in students’
papers. One, for example, is a town of about one
thousand people, in a former lumbering district. When
the lumbering declined the more energetic families moved
out, leaving a class of people lacking in leadership and isolated
from higher influences. There is no inspiration or
outlook for the young people, no clubs, libraries, athletics,
or Christian Associations. The schools are very poor,
and the saloon with its attendant vices has everything
its own way. In such a place things often go from bad
to worse; families already degenerate move in, because
they can get a footing easier than elsewhere, and inbreeding,
both social and biological, tends to a continued deterioration.</p>

<p class='c013'>In other cases the towns are prosperous, in the economic
sense, but sordid, narrow-minded, and lacking in all animating
idealism. The leading people are, perhaps, orthodox
church-members, but they provide no culture opportunities
or wholesome recreation for the young, and seem
to have no ambition for them beyond pecuniary success.
Sexual vice, with or without drunkenness, seems to be
the most salient form of corruption under these circumstances,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>and careful observers, who have been teachers
in such communities, have furnished me convincing evidence
that a majority of the grown-up girls and young
men are sometimes involved in it.</p>

<p class='c013'>A great city often induces degeneracy in neighboring
small towns, because, the towns becoming suburban in
character, the real life of the energetic people is drawn to
the city, leaving the small place without leadership, ideals,
or community spirit. There is also the fact that every
large city produces a class of vicious pleasure-seekers who
carry on their revels in the outlying districts.</p>

<p class='c013'>Again, there are rural populations of considerable extent,
sometimes immigrant, more often native, which, in
one way or another, have fallen into a degenerate condition,
and are living quite apart from higher civilization.
A community of this sort is described as dwelling on exhausted
timber-lands in western Pennsylvania, its members
shiftless, uneducated, half wild in appearance, with
no ownership in the land, and believed to be generally
licentious.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is not at all necessary, however, to hunt out exceptional
conditions to find examples of moral stagnation.
We may discover it among business men, hand-workers,
college students—wherever we may choose to look.
Our civilization, whatever its promise, is far from having
solved the problem of maintaining an upward striving
in all its members.</p>

<p class='c010'>The organization of society may not only fail to give
human nature the moral support it needs, but may be
of such a kind as actively to promote degeneration. On
its worse side the whole system of commercialism, characteristic
of our time, is of this sort. That is, its spirit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>is largely mechanical, unhuman, seeking to use mankind
as an agent of material production, with very little regard,
in the case of the weak classes, for breadth of life,
self-expression, outlook, hope, or any kind of higher life.
Men, women, children, find themselves required to work
at tasks, usually uninteresting and often exhausting,
amidst dreary surroundings, and under such relations to
the work as a whole that their imagination and loyalty
are little, if at all, aroused. Such a life either atrophies
the larger impulses of human nature or represses them
to such a degree that they break out, from time to time,
in gross and degrading forms of expression. I have in
mind an investigation by a woman student of the amusements
of factory girls in a neighboring city. It showed
that the poorer class of them were overworked during the
week, were too tired to go out at night, and had unattractive
homes. On Saturday night many of them found
their only emotional outlet in commercial dance-halls,
where the men were strangers and where the surroundings
were more or less vicious. The girls were of no worse
disposition than other girls, but many of them were deteriorating
morally under these conditions. This, of
course, is what has been found true in a hundred other
cities.</p>

<p class='c013'>The deliberate promotion of vice under the impulse of
gain comes naturally in to exploit the weak places in human
nature. It has been shown in the case of sexual
licentiousness that the natural sensuality and weakness
of men and women but partly explain its prevalence; we
have to add the coaxing and stimulation of an organized
propaganda. Miss Addams, in her work A New Conscience
and an Ancient Evil, describes the corruption of
children, intentional and unintentional, on a large scale.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Their minds are tainted by shows, dance-halls, overcrowding,
contact with the licentious class, and finally
by deliberate training in vice. Much the same may be
said of drink, gambling, and theft, not to speak of the
more intangible forms of corruption rife in business and
politics.</p>

<p class='c013'>Organization of this sort arises spontaneously, as it
were, out of the universal appetite for gain and the obvious
weaknesses of human nature; it therefore almost
always enters the field ahead of the organization aiming
to counteract it—the legal restrictions, educational and
rescue work, social centres, and the like—and is likely to
flourish almost unchecked in a raw civilization. It owes
its strength no more to gross passions than to the absence
of alternatives that enables it to pervert to base
uses the finer impulses, those calling for companionship,
recreation, cheerful and unconstraining surroundings.</p>

<p class='c012'>HEREDITY AND ENVIRONMENT—THEIR DISTINCTIVE FUNCTIONS—THE
SPECIAL CHARACTER OF HUMAN HEREDITY—INTERACTION
OF THE TWO PROCESSES—POSSIBLE ANTAGONISM—THE MORAL
ASPECT—PRACTICAL DIFFICULTY OF DISTINGUISHING THE TWO—FUTILITY
OF THE USUAL CONTROVERSY</p>

<p class='c010'>In a large view, heredity and environment are not opposing
influences, as is commonly imagined, but complementary
and co-operating organs of life, each having its
appropriate part to play in the great whole. They are
like man and woman, in that the question regarding them
is not which is greater or more indispensable, but just
what are their respective functions, and how do they or
should they work together. Those men of science who,
lacking comprehensive views, have stated the problem as
one of “nature <em>versus</em> nurture” have merely fallen in with
the popular misapprehension. It is quite as if they had
stated the problem of the family as one of man <em>versus</em>
woman.</p>

<p class='c013'>Heredity gives some men an ambitious spirit, and this
is neither more nor less important than the direction their
ambition takes, which is a matter of environment; they
are different kinds of things and cannot well be weighed
against each other. No more was the military talent, let
us say, of General Grant more or less important to his
life than the outbreak of the Civil War, which gave it a
chance to develop.</p>

<p class='c013'>We have to do with two processes, or two branches of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>a common process, going on side by side, and each contributing
in its way to the total movement of organic
life. In the case of the biological process or branch the
material vehicle of life is the germ-plasm, a special kind
of cells set apart for the transmission of hereditary types.
In this there is a complex mingling and development of
tendencies in accordance with laws of heredity which are
as yet obscure. The social phase of the process takes
place through the medium of psychical communication,
the vehicle being language, in the widest sense of the word,
including writing, printing, and every means for the transmission
of thought. Through this, social types are propagated
somewhat as biological types are believed to be
in the germ-plasm. In each of these mediums there is a
kind of growth, of selection, of adaptation of types to
one another, and of survival of some at the expense of
others. It should be our aim to see the two as organs of
a common whole and to explain how they are related to
each other.</p>

<p class='c010'>The best way to get this larger view, probably, is to
consider the evolution of the matter and note how heredity
and environment, as we see them working in man,
have developed from lower forms of life. Among animals
and plants the actions that enable a living being to cope
with its surroundings and thus survive are secured mainly
by heredity, and come into the world ready-made, as it
were, with little or no need to be fashioned by a supplementary
social process. Animal conduct, as broadly contrasted
with human, is a system of fixed hereditary responses
to fixed stimuli; the instinct is like a hand-organ
which will play certain tunes whenever you turn the
crank, and will play no others no matter what you do.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>If this predetermined reaction meets the needs of life, if
the tune is in harmony with events, the life of the organism
is furthered. But this can scarcely be unless the conditions
of life have been nearly uniform through many
generations, so that the instinctive mechanism has had
time to become adjusted to them by a series of survivals
and eliminations, such as is required for “natural selection.”
If a newly hatched chick has come to have the
instinct to pick up and swallow small objects of a certain
appearance, this implies that such objects, for ages past,
have on the whole proved to be digestible and supported
life; if they ceased to do so the race of chickens, I suppose,
would die out.</p>

<p class='c013'>The distinctive thing in human evolution, on the other
hand, is the development of a process which is not fixed
but plastic, which adapts itself directly to each particular
situation, and is capable of an indefinite number of appropriate
and successful modes of action. This happy
result involves a change in the hereditary process, as well
as the rise of a new process to supplement it. The hereditary
tendencies, instead of remaining definite and fixed,
have to become vague and plastic in order that they may
be moulded into the infinitely various forms of human
conduct. The hand-organ has to become a piano, which
will yield no tune at all except under the touch of a trained
player, but under such a touch is capable of infinite melody.</p>

<p class='c013'>The player, to carry out the analogy, is the human intelligence
trained by working with the social environment.
This is the agent through which situations are understood
and hereditary tendencies organized to meet them. The
instinctive life is no longer a mere mechanism as—comparatively
at least—it was before, but a plastic thing with
a mind to guide it. And this new, distinctively human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>process implies a complex social life, with a system of
communication, tradition, and education; because it is
through these that intelligence is enabled to develop and
to organize its control.</p>

<p class='c010'>The human process, then, involves a plastic heredity
prepared to submit itself to the guidance of environment
as interpreted by intelligence. The distinctively human
heredity is not an inborn tendency to do definite things,
but an inborn aptitude to learn to do whatever things
the situation may call for.</p>

<p class='c013'>Just what is it, then, that we owe to heredity? In
general it is capacity, or, more exactly, <em>lines of teachability</em>.
We must depend upon the environment to stimulate and
define this capacity, to supply teaching along these lines.
When we say that a child is a born musician we mean,
not that he can play or compose by nature alone, but
that if he has the right kind of teaching he can rapidly
develop power in this direction. In this sense, and in no
other, a man may be a born lawyer, or teacher, or poet,
or, if you please, a born counterfeiter or burglar.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suppose that twin children are born with precisely the
same hereditary tendencies, and that one of these is carried
off and brought up in a French family, while the other
remains with its parents in America: how would they
be alike, and how different? Presumably their temperaments,
as energetic or sluggish, and their general lines of
ability, so far as these found any encouragement, would
remain similar. But all definite development would depend
upon the environment. The former child would
speak French and not English; if he developed ambition
the objects of it would be suggested by the life around him,
his whole system of ideas would be French, he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>enter body and soul into the social process of France.
And so it would be if he were taken to Germany, or China.</p>

<p class='c013'>A good heredity is something very different from hereditary
goodness, in the sense of good conduct. The latter
does not exist, while the former is simply an inheritance
of lines of capacity corresponding to the chief lines of human
function; a good raw material for social influence to
work up, just as sound timber is good for houses, ships, or
what-not. And this sort of heredity is a condition of
biological survival because it alone makes possible the
education of individuals and their organization into those
plastic social wholes, with innumerable special functions,
upon which the life and power of man is based.</p>

<p class='c013'>Along with this plastic heredity and inseparable from
it we have the social process, which does not antagonize
the biological process, or supplant it, but utilizes the
change in its character to add a new world of psychical
interaction and growth. Like the older process it is continuous
through the ages, and builds up vast organic
wholes, of which the individual may seem only an insignificant
detail. As we have biological types, on the one
hand, so, on the other, we now have types of culture and
institutions.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus the life of humanity comes to be a single vital
process having two parallel and interdependent subprocesses,
the hereditary and the social. Each of these
has a sphere of its own, that of heredity being, in general,
the production of physical and mental aptitude, and
that of society the creation, by the aid of this aptitude, of a
progressing social order.</p>

<p class='c013'>Each system acts selectively upon the other, determining
what will work and what will not. Hereditary types
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>must in some way fit into the social conditions or they cannot
propagate themselves and must disappear. If a man
cannot, by hook or crook, manage to raise a family, that
part of the hereditary stream which flows in him is lost,
and the type he represents declines. In like manner, if
a race, or a national stock, does not succeed in developing
such forms of personality and social organization as
to enable it to keep a footing and multiply its kind in the
actual conditions of life, it must diminish. The social
organization sets standards of fitness which the biological
process must meet.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is equally true, on the other hand, that the biological
type acts selectively in determining what social ideas and
institutions will work, and how. You may give the same
lecture to a hundred students, but what each one makes
of it will depend, in part, on his natural gifts. Or you
may plant the same ideas of free government among the
Americans, the Swiss, the French, the people of the Argentine,
and the Liberian Negroes; but their growth will
be very different, partly, again, because of a difference in
hereditary capacity.</p>

<p class='c013'>If we wish for analogies to illustrate this relation we
must look for them among other cases of distinct but complementary
organisms living together in interaction and
mutual adaptation, such as man and wife in the family,
the nervous and alimentary systems in the body, the state
and the church in the social system of mediæval Europe,
or the national and State governments in the American
commonwealth—organisms which may be regarded either
as two or as one, according to the purpose in hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>There may be a kind of conflict between the biological
and the social currents of life, just as there may between
almost any two factors in a co-operative whole. Men of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>genius, for example, rarely leave a normal number of
descendants; they develop themselves socially at the expense
of reproduction, though, if there is anything in Mr.
Galton’s views, reproduction is, in their case, peculiarly
desirable.<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c014'><sup>[51]</sup></a> The same is perhaps true in general of the
more intellectual and ambitious types of men: it might
be better for the race stock if they put more of their energy
into raising families and less into social achievement.
At least, this would be the immediate result: in the long
run perhaps the social achievement will indirectly contribute
to improve the stock.</p>

<p class='c013'>A rather striking example of opposition is found in the
monastic system. There is little doubt that this sprang
from profound needs of the human spirit and, at its best,
played a great part in the higher life. But if its social
working was good its effect upon the race is believed to
have been detrimental, since for centuries it selected the
most intellectual and aspiring men and prevented their
leaving offspring. Just as hereditary stocks may flourish
although bad for society, so social movements may prosper
that are bad for heredity.</p>

<p class='c010'>The practical truth of the matter, from a moral standpoint,
may largely be contained in the statement that we
get capacity from heredity, conduct from society. The
critical thing in the latter is the use that is made of hereditary
powers, whether they are to work upward or downward,
as judged by social standards. While it is true
that no amount or kind of education will take the place
of initial capacity, it is true also that there is no source
of right development and function except social teaching;
the best heredity is powerless in this regard.</p>

<p class='c013'>The question of crime offers good illustrations. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>are kinds of crime which depend upon defective heredity,
because they involve incapacity to acquire normal social
functions. It is easier to discriminate these in theory
than in practice, but it is well known that a considerable
portion of our criminals are feeble-minded or ill balanced.
But if a criminal has normal capacity, as the majority
have, we must attribute his degeneracy to the fact that
he has come under worse social influences rather than
better. And the more ability he has, the more pernicious
a criminal he makes. The same division may be made
in any line of human function; we can never dispense
with capacity, but there is no capacity of which we may
not make a bad use.</p>

<p class='c010'>While the theory of the matter is not difficult, when
one approaches it in this way, the applications are obscure,
simply because it is hard to get at the facts. That
is, we ordinarily cannot tell with any precision what the
original hereditary outfit was, and just how it was developed
by social influences. Even if we could study every
child at birth it would not help us much, because, although
the heredity is there, we have no art to know what it is
until it works out in life, and it works out only in social
development. Practically the two factors are always
found in co-operation, and our knowledge that they are
separable is largely derived from the lower forms of life
where the social process is absent.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is often possible, however, to reach useful conclusions
from indirect evidence. If, for example, hereditary stocks
which are not remarkable for crime and vice in one environment
rapidly become so in another, we may believe
that the environment is the factor most in need of correction.
This is the case with the immigrant population in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>our badly governed cities. On the other hand, if we find
that individuals of a certain stock generally turn out ill,
no matter in what conditions they may be placed, the
argument for bad heredity is strong. This applies to
many studies of degenerate lines, for which Dugdale’s
work on The Jukes set the example.</p>

<p class='c013'>Where the matter is in doubt, as it must be in most
cases, our line of action would seem to be somewhat as
follows: If we are trying to better the conduct of living
men and women, whose heredity, for better or worse, is
already determined, we must proceed on the theory that
environment is to blame, and try to better that. But if
we are dealing with conditions that affect propagation,
we should lean the other way. I mean that, if we find
people living in a degeneracy which cannot clearly be
ascribed to anything exceptional in the environment, we
ought to hold the stock suspect, and prevent its propagation
if we can. The cause that we have power over is
always the one to emphasize.</p>

<p class='c010'>The popular discussions of this matter proceed, for the
most part, from a misapprehension of its nature. Heredity
and environment are usually conceived as rival claimants
to the control of life, and argument consists in urging the
importance of one or the other, very much as boys’ debating
societies sometimes discuss the question whether
Washington or Lincoln was the greater man.</p>

<p class='c013'>The views of even scientific men on this point have been
for the most part crude and one-sided, owing chiefly to
the fact that they have approached it from the standpoint
of a specialty and without sound general conceptions.
Biologists are apt to regard the stream of heredity as the
great thing, and the social process as quite a secondary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>matter, important mainly as the means of a eugenic
propaganda.<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c014'><sup>[52]</sup></a> Sociologists, on the other hand, naturally
exalt the process with which they are familiar, and seldom
admit that the other is of equal moment. Both sides
often seem to share the popular view that heredity and
environment, society and the germ-plasm, are in some way
opposites, so that whatever is granted to the one must
be taken from the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>Most of the writers on eugenics have been biologists or
physicians who have never acquired that point of view
which sees in society a psychological organism with a life
process of its own. They have thought of human heredity
as a tendency to definite modes of conduct, and of environment
as something that may aid or hinder, not remembering,
what they might have learned even from Darwin,
that heredity takes on a distinctively human character only
by renouncing, as it were, the function of predetermined
adaptation and becoming plastic to the environment.
In this state of mind they are capable of expressions like
the following, from reputable authors: “Our experience
is that nature dominates nurture, and that inheritance
is more vital than environment.” “Education is to the
man what manure is to the pea.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Writers of this school are apt to think they have proved
their case when they have shown that environment cannot
overcome heredity; but this is as if one should argue
that because a wife retains a personality of her own she
must have conquered her husband. No doubt, what we
get in the germ-cell is ours for life, and environment can
only control, or perhaps suppress, its development. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>it is equally true that heredity cannot overcome environment.
If a man grows up in England no heredity will
enable him to speak Chinese; and in general he must
build up his life out of the arts, customs, and ideas supplied
him by society.</p>

<p class='c013'>Equally extravagant statements may be found on the
other side; to the effect, for example, that heredity has
nothing to do with crime. Socialists are apt to scoff at
heredity because they wish to fix attention upon capitalism
and other economic factors. Evidently what is needed
is a larger view on both parts.</p>

<p class='c013'>I might say that this topic affords a kind of <em>pons asinorum</em>
for one phase of sociology, a test problem to determine
whether an applicant is capable of thinking
clearly in this field. If so, then no one has crossed the
bridge who is capable of asserting, as a general proposition,
that heredity is more important or more powerful
than environment, or <em>vice versa</em>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such views are examples of the particularism that is so
rife in social discussion, and is the opposite of the organic
conception, the latter recognizing that the phenomena
form an interdependent whole, every part of which is a
cause of all the other parts. The particularist follows the
line of causation from one point and in one direction from
that point; the organic thinker sees the necessity of following
it from many points and in all directions.</p>

<p class='c013'>The lack of a good nomenclature is a serious bar to
clear thinking upon these matters. How can we differentiate
the biological and social processes when nearly
all the words in general use may mean either? Although
“heredity” is coming to be understood chiefly in a biological
sense, there is a far older usage in the sense of social
heirship, which is established in law, and not likely to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>abandoned. And the noun “inheritance,” the verb “to
inherit,” the adjectives “hereditary” and “inheritable”
are used indiscriminately and smother the distinction.
It would seem that the biologists, as the later comers,
may fairly be called upon to give us new terms for the
process they are bringing to light.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>ACTION OF THE SOCIAL ORDER ON SURVIVAL—SIZE OF A NORMAL
FAMILY—SOCIAL CHECKS ON THE IMPULSE TO PROPAGATION—THE
FAMILY LINE AS AN IDEAL—FACTORS IN MARRIAGE SELECTION—INFLUENCE
OF THE WOMAN’S MOVEMENT—UNSETTLED
CONDITIONS</p>

<p class='c010'>All the hereditary types or strains in a given society
may be said to be competing for survival, with the social
system as the arbiter of success. That is, a type can hold
its own only as its individuals can make themselves at
home in the social environment and bring to maturity at
least an average number of offspring to continue it.
Thus, as regards merely physical needs, social conditions
may involve either ample nutrition and protection or
starvation and exposure to destructive climates and diseases.
The wide-spread devastation of savage races in
recent times is explained in part by the social events
which have brought them in contact with European diseases
and intoxicants, and there is an analogous condition
in the destructive influences acting upon the very
poor in all societies.</p>

<p class='c013'>This, however, is only the more obvious part of the
truth. More subtly the social condition determines how
any hereditary type develops and whether it has a sort of
life that is favorable to propagation. The whole process
of survival is, from one point of view, a matter of social
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>psychology. Psychological influences direct the development
of the instincts, guiding the selection of one sex
by the other, and of both by the social group.</p>

<p class='c013'>The question just how a hereditary type must be related
to the social system in order to survive cannot be
answered in any simple way. It is not safe to say that
the most successful types, in a social sense, have the best
chance of survival; such types often tend to sterility.
This may take place through the absorption of their energies
in social activities at the expense of propagation;
also through overfeeding or lack of incentive, leading to
moral decay. Nor do the types that fail socially necessarily
fail to propagate, since traits like lack of foresight,
which diminish success, may increase the number of offspring.</p>

<p class='c010'>In order that a hereditary type may survive equally
with others the individuals belonging to it must bring to
maturity at least as many children, in proportion to their
number, as those of other types. It is not sufficient that
those having children should rear enough of them to replace
the parents; they must also compensate for several
sources of loss. A considerable proportion of persons,
from lack of vitality or other reasons, do not marry, or,
being married, have no children, or lose those they have
by early death. And, beyond this, there must be enough
surplus of children to give the type they represent its
share in the general increase of population.</p>

<p class='c013'>The failure of a part of the individuals of good stock
to leave children is not necessarily a fault: in some degree
it is an elimination of the weak that is essential to the
welfare of the stock, whose vigor is not the same in all.
Many of the celibate or sterile are such because they
lack normal vitality. I think we can all find in our own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>circle of acquaintance people of excellent descent who are
healthy enough, perhaps, but seem to lack that surplus
of life which would make us feel that they are born to
be fathers or mothers. At any rate, others must do what,
for no matter what reason, they fail to do.</p>

<p class='c013'>Just how many offspring the average family must have
to meet these requirements is not easy to calculate precisely,
as the number varies with the death-rate, the proportion
of celibates and barren marriages, the rate of
general increase and other factors. I have consulted several
statistical experts, but found none of them willing
to make a definite estimate for the United States. I
should say, roughly, that a stock cannot hold its own in
numbers with an average of less than four children to a
fertile marriage, and considering the large general rate of
increase in this country, five would probably be nearer
the mark. A family of three children or less, where the
parents are of good descent and, physically and as regards
income, capable of having more, must be reckoned
a “race-suicide” family, not doing its share in keeping
up the stock.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was formerly assumed that the impulse to propagation,
in human as in animal types, was to be taken for
granted, the only question being how far the economic
conditions would allow this impulse to become effective.
A closer study shows that the control of society begins
further back, and can easily modify the development of
the instincts themselves in such a way that they cease
to impel natural increase. Gratification of the sexual
impulses may be separated from reproduction, and it
may well come to pass that the classes in which they have
the fullest sway are the least prolific. The maternal instinct,
though less apt to lapse into sensuality, is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>much more certain in its operation. It may expend itself
on one or two children, or even be directed to other
objects.</p>

<p class='c013'>Modern conditions tend strongly to what is called birth-control,
that is, to making the number of children a matter
of intention, and not of mere physiology. This is in
accord with the general increase of choice, and we may
hope that it will work out well in the long run, but it calls
for a new conscience and a new intelligence in this connection.
The old process did not require that people should
know anything about eugenics, or feel the duty of raising
a good-sized family; that was left to unconscious forces;
but now that they are coming to have no more children
than they want, it is evident that, unless those who represent
the better strains want the requisite number, such
strains must decline. And as birth-control prevails most
in the intelligent classes, the possibility of deterioration is
manifest. Only eugenic ideals and conduct can save
from depletion those stocks which share most fully in
the currents of progress.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fact that intelligence saves on the death-rate and
enables the type to be maintained by a smaller number
of births is of some moment, but we must not imagine
that any saving of this sort will enable families of two or
three children to keep up a thriving stock.</p>

<p class='c013'>There seems to be some disposition to blink the quantitative
side of this problem, especially, perhaps, among
women, upon whom the hardships and anxieties of rearing
children mainly fall. They are apt to be more interested
in taking better care of children than in having
more of them. And yet, from the standpoint of race
welfare, and having regard to the actual state of things
in the well-to-do classes, the number is pretty clearly the
more urgent matter of the two. If the maternal instinct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>expends itself upon solicitude for one or two or even three
children, refusing a larger number, it becomes accessory
to the decline of the type. It is mere confusion of thought
to suppose that, in this matter, quality can make up for
lack of quantity.</p>

<p class='c013'>And, so far as quality is concerned, there is good reason
to think that where the parents are not in actual poverty
a family of four children or more, large enough to create
a vigorous group life, is better for the development of a
child than one of two or three.</p>

<p class='c010'>It seems that what we mainly need in this connection
is some resuscitation, in a changed form, of the old ideal
of the family line. We have, from this point of view,
gone too far in differentiating the individual from his kin,
having almost ceased to identify ourselves with our ancestors
or descendants, and to find self-expression in the
size and importance of the family group. People hardly
comprehend any longer the sentiment, quite general until
within a century or two, that a man’s position and repute
were one with that of a continuing stock whose traits were
imputed to him as a matter of course. We no longer introduce
ourselves, as in Homer, by naming our descent,
or rely upon our posterity for credit. We cannot lose
the sense of race without impairing the fact of race.</p>

<p class='c013'>I know that precisely this sense has been one of the
main obstacles to democracy, equality of opportunity,
and the whole modern movement, so that public opinion
has come to identify it with reaction. Nor do I think
that the danger from it is altogether past. Nevertheless,
progress is to be had not by abandoning old ideals altogether,
but by their control and adaptation; and the
race sentiment still has essential functions. Where it
flourishes success and fecundity tend to go together:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>the stocks that gain social power and resource express
these, in part, by leaving a numerous offspring. And in
so far as the successful stocks are the better stocks, this
means race-improvement.</p>

<p class='c010'>If we assume, notwithstanding the foregoing, that marriage
is, on the whole, a step toward propagation, we
arrive at the question of selection in marriage. Any
type of man or woman that is to hold its own in heredity
must be qualified to secure the co-operation of the other
sex in this relation.</p>

<p class='c013'>The choice of the sexes in marriage is in great part an
expression of the values prevalent in the social group at
large. It is impracticable to separate the individual
judgment from that of society. This is evidently true
where, as is so widely the case, marriages are based on
wealth, social position, or success in any of the forms admired
by the group. The valuation of a suitor, in the
mind of a girl’s family, and even in the mind of the girl
herself, is largely a function of his valuation by other
people, and the same is true for the woman, whose reputation,
wealth, and capacity as a housewife are important
factors in her desirability. Even in the matter of sexual
attraction there is a large conventional element. We
know how women are dazzled by prestige and position on
the part of men, while “style” and the like are almost
equally effective in their own case. The sexual emotions
function in connection with the mind as a whole, and
that is moulded by the general mind of the group. It is
certain, however, that although sexual value is largely
an institutional value there is also a factor of immediate
human nature in it. I mean that there are, on both sides,
vague but powerful elements of sex attraction that spring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>from instinct and are little subject to convention. It is
hard to say just what these are, but we all feel them in
the other sex, and no one doubts that they come from an
immemorial evolution.</p>

<p class='c013'>The tendency of the modern movement toward individuality
and personal choice has been to give freer play
to preference in the man and woman who are to marry,
increasing the influence of the human-nature values and
rendering marriage, on the whole, more intimate and congenial.
This ought to make for the propagation of manly
types of men and womanly types of women, types strongly
vital and sexual after their several kinds. It really seems
to work in this way, though the vagaries of personal choice
may often be inscrutable.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is still true, however, that the outcome must depend
much upon the state of the public mind. If marriage is
generally felt to be a social institution, with grave public
functions, so that everything connected with it is judged
by its bearing on the welfare of the next generation, if
heredity is regarded and the need of economic support
given due weight, without excluding those intuitions
which the young may be trusted not to neglect, then the
better types ought to be chosen. But if marriage is hasty
and frivolous, if the prevalent opinion regards it as a
mere matter of personal gratification, if a child is looked
upon as a nuisance or a pet, then the biological outlook,
as well as the social, is bad. Which of these descriptions
more nearly applies to our society I leave the reader to
judge; it is certain that we need to do all we can to make
the former true.</p>

<p class='c010'>As to the effect of a larger participation by women in
forming our ideas regarding marriage selection, the number
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>of children and the like, all depends upon their developing,
as a class, an organized wisdom in these matters.
Already they have more power in this sphere than they
ever had before, and the hope of their making a good use
of it lies in their ideals and organization. If the results
of their enlargement are, so far, not altogether reassuring,
if there is much that seems anarchical and reckless of
race welfare in feminist tendencies, this may be because
we are in a transition state. Women have acquired power
while still somewhat unprepared to use it, and what they
need is probably more responsibility along with the
training requisite to meet it. It is not clear that there
is any more extravagance in their movement than in those
for which men are responsible.</p>

<p class='c013'>The hopeful theory is that women, as the bearers of
maternal instinct and functions, are the natural curators
of the welfare of the race, and that, if they are trained and
trusted, they will prove adequate to this function. We
must at least admit that it is hard to see any other way
out. They have already so much freedom that it is
hardly possible to deny them more, in this direction where
they have so strong a claim upon it. Eugenics cannot
now be forced upon them; if they do not bring it in, or
take a leading part in the work, no other agency can.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another encouraging reflection is that there is no reason
to believe that women will, in the long run, reject any
real wisdom that the male mind may be able to contribute.</p>

<p class='c010'>I am inclined to believe that much of the frivolity that
seems to prevail in marriage selection may be ascribed
to a disorganization of standards, such as we see in
other phases of life. A confused time naturally lacks
settled habits of choice that reflect the underlying social
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>requirements. Where <em>mores</em> are unformed, caprice flourishes.
In a society or class that has long been face to face
with rather severe conditions of life, such, for example,
as the peasantry of all old countries, we find customs and
habits of thought that are suited to survival in the face
of such conditions. The personal traits that the situation
demands have come to be required in marriage—strength,
energy, and steadfastness in men, and maternal and domestic
capacity in women. These traits become typical
of the class, and traits that conflict with them are weeded
out. But with us unsettled conditions and laxity of standards
have given course to mere impulse or meaningless
currents of fashion. There is such a thing as biological
discipline, in which we are perhaps as lacking as in social.</p>

<p class='c010'>In order to discuss the economic factors affecting the
propagation of different types of men it may be well to
divide the population roughly into three classes: the
well-to-do at one extreme, those in actual want at the
other, and the vast intermediate class who come under
neither description. Such a division is arbitrary, but may
serve to indicate certain influences bearing upon our
question. Let us include in the first, families whose income
is $2,000 or more, in the second, those whose income
is less than $600, and in the third, families whose
income is between these amounts.<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c014'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The first class is the successful class, judged by pecuniary
standards, and includes not only prosperous business
men, but the better paid of the professional class, and of
men living on salaries. The prevailing tendency in this
part of society, subject of course to many exceptions and
modifications, appears to be to sacrifice the size of the
family to other interests. This is the class which easily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>forms habits of luxury, and develops costly and exacting
ideals regarding the nurture and education of its children.
For the money spent upon them no pecuniary return is expected,
and the hardship and responsibility inseparable
from the rearing of a family appear greater by contrast
with habits of ease. It is also in this class that personal
choice is most cultivated, and the sophistication that applies
this to limiting the number of children, so that, although
the death-rate is low, the birth-rate is scarcely
sufficient to offset it. Relatively to other and more prolific
parts of the population the stocks represented in this
class may be regarded as tending to decline.<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c014'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The biological significance of this depends upon the
value of these stocks, upon what distinctive biological
traits, if any, are to be found in well-to-do families as a
group. The prevalent view among eugenic writers, led
by Galton, has been that the successful class, on the
whole, represents the ablest stocks, and that eugenic
progress depends mainly upon securing a high rate of increase
among them. Galton himself held that all other
eugenic aims were of secondary importance. It should
be noted, however, that he did not propose to measure
success merely by income, but rather by established reputation
among the group best able to judge of a particular
kind of merit. His eugenic aristocracy would consist,
for example, of those lawyers, artists, men of letters, men
of science, and even of those skilled artisans, who are regarded
by their colleagues as able men of their kind.
The business group would no doubt be included but would
not be allowed an importance at all corresponding to its
wealth. At the apex of this aristocracy would be men of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>genius, the test of genius being great and enduring reputation.<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c014'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>This view of the eugenic superiority of the successful
class, in conjunction with the smallness of the families in
this class, has led to pessimistic views regarding the
future of the race. Some writers hold that civilization
necessarily exhausts a stock, that such exhaustion has
been the main cause of the decay of great nations in the
past, and that the process was never so rapid as in our
own time. Others think that, although the decline is
real, it has not yet gone very far, and that we may be
saved from it by a rational eugenics.</p>

<p class='c013'>The argument that civilization, especially modern
civilization, tends to race deterioration is simple and, to
say the least, plausible. Civilization selects the best
stocks and uses them up. The ablest types of men, incited
by ambition, achieve success and carry on the more
intellectual and exhausting functions of the social order.
At the same time their success subjects them to the upper-class
conditions of luxury and exacting ideals. The result
is infecundity of the successful class, and of the superior
stocks which it represents. The best grain is eaten
and the next crop raised from inferior seed.</p>

<p class='c013'>This process may be peculiarly rapid in a democracy
like ours, because it is our tendency, and indeed our
ideal, to make the rise of natural ability as free and rapid
as possible. When life in general was traditional, functions
inherited or customary, and opportunity confined to
a few, the process by which natural ability rose to the top
and evaporated was slow and uncertain. But now, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>our universal spurring of ambition, our racial resources
are rapidly spent, and, short of a change in the ideals
and way of life of the successful class, it is not apparent
how they can be saved.<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c014'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The opinion upon which all this depends, that the successful
class represents the best stocks, is, however, open
to question. One criticism of it is that opportunity and
success are still mainly a matter of privilege rather than
of natural ability; and many assert that in spite of our
ideal of equal opportunity the ascendancy of privilege is
increasing, and that nothing short of a revolution can
overthrow it. If this view is at all correct it undermines
the whole idea that the present successful class represents
an aristocracy of natural ability, or has especial eugenic
significance of any kind.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is worth noting, however, that one may allow much
present dominance of privilege, but hold that, in spite of
it, there is a continuous flow of able stocks toward the
top, so that the upper strata probably have a considerable
eugenic superiority. And if we believe that improvements
in education are increasing opportunity as against
privilege, this superiority should be growing. In that
case it would be a great object to insure fecundity in these
strata.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another line of criticism would question whether the
hereditary traits that make for success, as we now understand
it, are after all the ones we need to increase. Many
feel a lively dissatisfaction with the people who rule our
economic and political institutions; they are criticised
as selfish, unsocial, predatory. “The successful man, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>is alleged, is not a success.” Indeed, as a matter of
theory, it is by no means clear that those who gain the
economic prizes are those who are doing most for the welfare
of the race. The question might be put in this way:
Is not the desirable type the Christian type, using the
term to designate those who are swayed by a large fellow-feeling?
And is the successful type conspicuously Christian?
The affirmative of this does not seem very evident.
“Many that are first shall be last.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Besides selfish ambition, there are other traits that
might push a man upward but not be desirable to increase.
Is not the successful class deficient in domestic impulses?
They appear to be unprolific, and this may indicate that
the instincts are weak, causing the sacrifice of family
life to ambition. Perhaps the infecundity of this class
is only the wholesome elimination of an unsocial type.
The best type of man may be too broadly human for
economic success.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the other hand, there is good sense in the view
that success is usually attained by qualities of general
value, such as energy, initiative, tenacity, and intelligence;
and that, so far as it is accompanied by selfishness, lack of
domesticity, and the like, we may ascribe this rather to
environment than to any defect in the hereditary type.
There is much in success to make a man selfish.</p>

<p class='c013'>The eugenic superiority of the upper economic class
may also be questioned on the ground that the conditions
for <em>maintaining</em> a superior stock are not so good in this
class as in a less prosperous part of society. The tests
are not so rigid; people who are supported by inherited
wealth may raise families whether they have shown any
natural ability or not. Their position is somewhat like
that of the chronic paupers at the other economic extreme,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>who raise degenerate families by the aid of charity. Certainly
there are many marriages of the sons and daughters
of the rich which do not seem based on personal merit,
either biologic or social.</p>

<p class='c013'>I suppose the reader will feel, as I do, that it is hardly
possible, in view of these conflicting considerations, to
form any precise idea of the relative eugenic value of the
upper economic class. My own impression, derived
mainly from general observation, is that it does, after all,
contain a large number of exceptionally able families,
many of which are becoming unprolific under the influences
of prosperity. If we can increase the fecundity of such
families by diffusing a higher sense of race obligation we
shall be doing excellent work for the next generation.</p>

<p class='c010'>If we embrace in the intermediate class those who
maintain themselves in tolerable comfort, but only by
steady work and close economy, never being able to accumulate
much surplus, it is by far the largest class of
the three, and one in which the conditions of survival
seem favorable to the increase of good types. The excess
of births over deaths is greater than among the upper
class, on the one hand, or among the misery class on the
other.</p>

<p class='c013'>The measure of success attained requires solid qualities,
such as intelligence and tenacity, in as great measure,
often, as a more brilliant career; and as there is no inherited
“independence,” these must be kept in constant
operation. Helpmates and “good providers” are appreciated
in marriage, though sexual intuitions also play a
large part. Domestic sentiment is strong and seldom
overshadowed by extravagant ambition.</p>

<p class='c013'>It seems that the selection of types and the maintenance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>of a sound eugenic standard—so far as it is maintained—is
chiefly accomplished here. Writers on eugenics have
given most of their attention to extremes, as Galton in
his work on Hereditary Genius, and Dugdale and later
writers in monographs on degenerate families; but while
conditions in these extremes are important they probably
count less than those in the far more numerous intermediate
class. Galton’s argument that the paramount
eugenic object is to increase the fecundity of the highly
successful types rests entirely upon his premise that these
types have an all-around superiority proportionate to
their success. If we reject this and deny that it is possible
to locate the source of future supermen in a small class,
then the “plain people” deserve our chief attention. The
type of man that can and will raise a family under medium
conditions is the type that must prevail in numbers,
and there is little reason to doubt that this is, on the
whole, a good type, or rather a variety of good types.
The mass of men we wish to be, first of all, well-proportioned
in mind and body, with health, sound nerves, intelligence,
perseverance, adaptability, and strong social
impulses. All these are qualities favorable to normal
success and fecundity.</p>

<p class='c013'>The higher evolution of the hereditary type is also, in
my judgment, to be looked for mainly through the slow
working of the requirements for mediocre success. If the
conditions of life are changing in such a manner as to require
greater intelligence, initiative, stability, and force
of character, as it seems to me likely that they are, it
would seem that these traits, so far as they are hereditary,
should be increased by the process of selection actually
going on. In this way we may hope that the human
stock will improve in the future as it probably has in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>past. A higher type of society develops a higher type of
man to work it, biological as well as social. This view is
somewhat speculative, as I am aware that there is no proof
that the breed of men has changed at all during historic
time,<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c014'><sup>[58]</sup></a> but it seems to me the most probable speculation.</p>

<p class='c013'>And, as regards practical eugenics, I should say that
one of our main aims should be to uphold the comparatively
healthy influences dominant in the great intermediate
class, as against the demoralizing ideals prevalent
among the rich.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXI<br> <span class='c011'>POVERTY AND PROPAGATION</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>IS POVERTY BENEFICIAL? EXTREME VIEWS, BIOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL—FALLACY
OF THE FORMER—OF THE LATTER—DANGER OF
IGNORING THE HEREDITARY FACTOR—SOCIAL CONDITIONS FAVORING
HEREDITARY IMPROVEMENT—BENEFITS OF MODERATE
HARDSHIP—POSSIBILITY OF SCIENTIFIC SELECTION—THE MORAL
CHECK AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO POVERTY</p>

<p class='c010'>We need to know how poverty is related to the survival
of types because it is regarding this, especially, that
we are required to have a definite policy. The hardships
of the very poor are felt as a call to do something;
but when we ask what we should do the answer depends
upon how we look upon their condition in relation to social
process. Is it a means to the “survival of the fittest,”
and, if so, does it work in such a way that the fit are the
desirable? Can it be abolished? Ought it to be abolished?
Is there any other way of accomplishing whatever
selective function it may now perform?</p>

<p class='c013'>There are two extreme views regarding this matter,
and all manner of intermediate modifications and compromises.
The biologist who sees life only in terms of
his specialty is apt to hold that the sufferings of the poor
are simply one form of the struggle for existence among
biological types, that this struggle is the method of evolution
here as everywhere; that it is salutary, though painful,
and that any attempt to interfere with it can do only
harm; that, in short, the net result of philanthropy is the
preservation of inferior types of mankind. This is supported
by statistics which aim to show that shiftless,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>vicious, diseased, and defective persons are enabled by
charity to raise large families of children.</p>

<p class='c013'>The other extreme is common among those who are
moved by first-hand knowledge of the poor, and feel so
strongly the inadequacy of the biological view that they
are eager to reject it altogether. Poverty, they say, is
the chronic disease of a certain part of society, in which
people are involved as they are in an epidemic. To have
it indicates no inherent weakness, no biological trait of
any kind; it does not discriminate and has, therefore, no
selective value. Moreover, it does not eliminate, as it
must in order to promote evolution. Those who contract
it, whether of inferior types or not, do not cease to
propagate, but increase more than the well-to-do, passing
on their misery to their children. And, beyond this,
poverty is propagated socially by the vice, squalor, shiftlessness
and inefficiency which are inseparable from it,
and spread from one family to another. The whole condition
is described as a running sore, which poisons all it
touches, and should be cured as a whole by remedial and
antiseptic treatment. The theory underlying this view
is that the sources of poverty are environmental, and that
difference of biological type has so little to do with it as
to be negligible. Or, assuming that it does play some
part, it is best got at by first removing the social causes,
after which any inferior hereditary types there may be
can be discerned and eliminated.</p>

<p class='c013'>Under this view philanthropy, or, more generally, deliberate
control of social conditions, is not “interference”
but an essential part of the evolutionary process. It
never has been nor can be absent so long as man is human
and feels his solidarity with his fellows. It has no
doubt done harm when unwise, but the remedy for this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>is not an impossible and illogical “letting alone,” but the
endeavor to make it wiser. Indeed the biological particularists
tacitly admit this by carrying on an educational
campaign.</p>

<p class='c010'>No one with any unbiased knowledge of the facts can
accept the crudely biological view. It is essentially an
<em>a priori</em> interpretation, drawn by analogy from subhuman
life. Selection by a merely brutal struggle (which even
among the animals is, in fact, modified by mutual aid)
is out of place, retrogressive, impossible on a large scale,
in human society; and a biology intelligent enough to
grasp the implications of the social process must reject it.</p>

<p class='c013'>To such an intelligent biology the ground for combating
poverty, disease and vice by social means is that this
is part of a campaign for securing conditions which <em>on
the whole</em> make for the survival of higher types. We
may lose something by it, we may preserve some who
might better die, but the general outcome of our campaign,
if rightly planned, is biologically good.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sound charity does not knowingly aid the propagation
of persons of inferior stock. It aims to distinguish them
from those who are merely suffering from bad environment,
and to set them apart in institutions or colonies,
while the others are given a chance in a better environment.
In no other way but by close and sympathetic
study can this distinction be made, so that the intelligent
social worker is the real social biologist, those who ignore
the social factor being doctrinaires.</p>

<p class='c013'>Moreover, except as we bring about good social conditions
we have no standard to tell what stocks <em>are</em> socially
desirable. Who are the “fit” whom we wish to preserve?
Fitness implies some general situation by which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>it is tested, and the kind we want is fitness for the higher
social order we are trying to build up, for the wise, just,
prosperous, and spiritually progressing state. The only
way to test for this is to create as high a social order as
we can, and give each competing type a chance to function
in it. To wipe out vast numbers by some crude
process on the assumption that it eliminates the “unfit”
will not do, or will do only so long as we are unable to
substitute some better mode of selection.</p>

<p class='c013'>If all of our babies were subjected to the conditions that
babies are subjected to in Terra del Fuego, most of them,
I suppose, would die of exposure, and a very rapid “natural
selection” would take place; but there is no reason to
suppose that, for civilized purposes, the surviving type
would be at all improved. The power to endure extreme
cold is only a small merit in modern life. In the same
way, of two children living in an infected tenement the
one who dies may be of a socially more desirable type
than the one who lives. The facts collected by Mr.
Havelock Ellis and others regarding the feeble childhood
of men of genius show how easily, under such a test, the
better types might perish.</p>

<p class='c013'>The extreme biological view involves the absurdity of
requiring that we tolerate indefinitely a bad state of society
in order to produce a stock that is fit for a good one.
Evidently the true way is to endeavor to better the society
and the stock at the same time, expecting each to
react favorably upon the other.</p>

<p class='c010'>I cannot, however, assent to the other extreme view,
namely, that poverty has nothing to do with hereditary
degeneracy and cannot in any manner or degree work
against it. My impression is that destructive conditions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>like misery, disease, and vice, though their action
is largely indiscriminate, nevertheless attack degenerate
stocks with special virulence, and have some tendency
to diminish them relatively to those that are sounder.
The process is crude and wasteful, needing to be replaced
by a better one, but it probably has had, and still has,
an important part in the evolution of the race.</p>

<p class='c013'>Say what you will of environmental factors in success
or failure, there is no reasonable doubt that differences of
natural capacity also enter. Under like conditions one
individual, because of inherent energy and intelligence,
may emerge from misery, while another, lacking these
traits, remains in it. And it is quite possible that the
same traits may lead the former on to a successful and
well-ordered life, including the raising of a normal family,
while the latter remains unprolific.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is not true, so far as I can judge from antecedent
probability, or from the evidence, that those who fall
below the misery line have, as a class, as large a natural
increase as those who rise somewhat above it. A steady
young man who can earn good wages, a competent housewifely
girl, are types favored in marriage, and likely to
rear families. And those who “do well” are also less
devitalized by exhaustion, discouragement, and dissipation.
They make good their place in the intermediate
class, have more children and bring a larger proportion
of them to maturity than they would if they had failed.
The small families of the rich have led many to overlook
the fact that among less prosperous people success and
fecundity are in some degree connected. I know the
common impression regarding the large families of the
shiftless and degenerate and admit that they are often
abnormally large. I think, however, the impression is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>on the whole exaggerated, perhaps because of our feeling
that such families ought to have no children at all.</p>

<p class='c013'>A standard work dealing with poverty in America
remarks that “the families of paupers or semi-paupers
usually average smaller than those of the population as
a whole, partly because the number among classes degenerate
enough to be dependent is not so large as ordinarily
supposed, partly because of a high infant mortality, and
partly because the families of these classes tend to disintegrate
rapidly.”<a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c014'><sup>[59]</sup></a> Admitting what exceptions you
please, I have little doubt that this will hold true on the
whole.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of dissipation we may say much the same as of economic
failure; heredity is certainly a factor in it, however
subordinate to environment, and the dissipated are, without
doubt, a comparatively unprolific class. Vice, alcoholism,
and irregularity of all kinds tend to diminish
fecundity. The sterility due to venereal disease alone
is enormous, though not confined, unfortunately, to the
licentious themselves, but extending to their wives and
children, and to whomever else they may contaminate.
Alcoholism leads to sexual vice, and also lowers intelligence
and vitality. It is true that drunkards often have
large families, but for one such case you will find perhaps
four of those who have formed no stable marriage relation.
It is a mere truism to say that, as a rule, dissipation
means a kind of life inconsistent with the raising of
a normal family.</p>

<p class='c010'>I think, then, we ought not, in dealing with poverty,
to ignore the possibility that inferiority of hereditary type
may be a factor in it. If people who cannot support a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>family actually have children, I would wish these to have
as good a chance as any; but so far as possible I would
prevent such people from having children. I favor reforms
aimed at reducing the infant death-rate, but think
they should be accompanied by other reforms aimed at
reducing the birth-rate among those who are unable to
maintain the social standards.</p>

<p class='c013'>Let me suggest an actual problem. It is well known
that the birth-rate of the Negroes in the South is very
high, so high that if it were not largely offset by a very
high infant death-rate, the colored people would soon
overwhelm the whites. Apparently, then, if social reforms
were rapidly introduced lowering the death-rate
of colored children to that of the whites, without other
reforms tending to lower their birth-rate, this overwhelming
would actually take place. I ask, then, whether,
from the white standpoint at least, this one-sided reform
would not be worse than none, and whether we might
not make a similar mistake by pushing improvements in
the care and feeding of infants without at the same time
pushing eugenic measures aimed at raising the standard
of heredity in the infants born.</p>

<p class='c013'>No doubt the shifting conditions of our society may
bring it to pass that large numbers are living below the
social standards from reasons quite apart from natural
incapacity. This is evidently the case with immigrants
coming from countries of lower standards and often undergoing
here exceptional economic and moral pressure.
The presumption is that any social inferiority they may
exhibit is due to environmental rather than hereditary
causes. I suppose the fact that most social workers in
America deal largely or wholly with immigrants has much
to do with the prevalence among them of the view that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>the hereditary causes of poverty are unimportant. The
greater stress put upon the latter in England may be connected
with the different character of English poverty.</p>

<p class='c010'>The social conditions best for the maintenance of the
biological type are neither very harsh nor very easy.
We need a real struggle to supply a test of what can make
good in life, but the conditions of this struggle should
ameliorate with social progress. Any test should conform
to the normal conditions of the system for which the test
is made; and any social struggle that is on a lower plane
is not a good test.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have heard it asserted that the best types are those
that can survive under the worst conditions; but this is
patently false. The test of extreme physical hardship
in infancy would probably tend to eliminate the higher
intellectual capacities. The best types are simply those
capable of the best function, and the more nearly we can
make good function on a high social level the test of survival
the better.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hardly anything gives rise to more confusion than discussing
the “struggle for existence” without a clear understanding
of the relativity of all struggle to conditions and
standards. When you say, “The struggle for existence is
a good thing,” the thoughtless infer that the harsher it
is the better. On the other hand, when you say, “The
struggle for existence (under misery conditions) is degrading,”
the thoughtless of another bias conclude that it
ought to be abolished and life made comfortable to all,
regardless of achievement. We need a struggle, with
standards to arouse exertion and to shut out incompetence;
and these standards should be the highest in
social requirement, and their enforcement the most humane
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>that we are able to establish. I take it that we are
trying to pass from low standards and brutal or haphazard
means of enforcement to a higher condition in
both respects.</p>

<p class='c010'>We need to distinguish rather sharply between moderate
hardship and a really degrading poverty, or, if you please,
between poverty and misery,<a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c014'><sup>[60]</sup></a> between a state in which
social standards <em>can</em> be maintained and one in which
they inevitably break down. The latter means general
retrogression, and is accompanied by conditions, such
as ignorance, disease and vice, which are destructive of
biological standards as well as social. The former permits
that real but not brutal struggle for existence which
is a part of the life of every people and essential as a
guarantee against degeneration.</p>

<p class='c013'>Is it not true that moderate economic hardship acts as
a frontier, a fighting-line, where fundamental standards,
both biological and social, are maintained, and hardy and
humane types of men are developed? There are kinds and
degrees of difficulty, sufficient to be exacting but not
enough to be destructive, that test and sift and reinvigorate
the people who pass through them.</p>

<p class='c013'>The case of the present immigrant to America is not so
different from that of the pioneer as we are apt to think.
He also comes from a crowded place to a place of opportunity,
and strives by a bold venture to better his condition
and enlarge the boundaries of life. Some succeed
and some fail; accident, we must admit, plays a great
part. Many of the attendant conditions are unfair and
demoralizing—as was the case with the pioneers. Nevertheless,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>the general outcome, even as things go now (and
we may hope to make them go much better), is the fostering
of vigorous types. The history of those who have
been in this country for two or three generations makes
this fairly evident.</p>

<p class='c013'>We need to watch this fighting-line and take care of
the wounded—see to it, that is, that those who fall into
misery are given a chance to recover, if they are capable
of it, and at any rate are not allowed to extend their condition
to whole neighborhoods and form infectious misery
environments. Unless we can abolish the struggle altogether,
which seems neither possible nor desirable, I
do not see how we can expect to avoid sporadic misery as a
by-product of it; but what we <em>can</em> do is so to standardize
the conditions of the struggle and the care of those who fail
as to prevent the growth of a self-perpetuating misery class.</p>

<p class='c010'>Scientific <em>a priori</em> tests of fitness to propagate, such as
may be developed by the aid of family records or medical
and psychological examinations, will probably be found
of increasing value in eliminating the definitely degenerate
by segregation or sterilization. It is not probable, however,
that they can ever meet the more general need of a
competitive standard of biological competence.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are two fundamental and possibly permanent
reasons why we cannot select our hereditary types artificially:
first, because we are not likely to agree as to
just what types are desirable, and, second, because if we
did agree there is no practicable method of ascertaining
the individuals belonging to these types and controlling
their propagation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Selective breeding is a comparatively simple matter
with domestic animals, where what we seek is a definite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>and easily ascertained trait like length or fineness of wool
in sheep, weight in hogs or beef-cattle, speed or strength
in horses, laying capacity in fowls, and so on. But in
the case of man we do not know just what we want, and
probably never shall. We should not dare to set up a
standard of physical vigor, for fear of excluding psychical
powers of more value; and the social and moral traits
which we might desire to increase do not manifest themselves
with certainty until rather late in life.</p>

<p class='c013'>Moreover, it is clear that the desirable thing in human
life is not one good type but many, a diversity of types
corresponding to multifarious and unforeseeable functions.
It is most unlikely that we shall ever assume to define
these types in advance.</p>

<p class='c013'>These difficulties seem so insuperable that it is hardly
necessary to go on and show that, owing to the great share
which environment has in producing desirable types of
character, it is difficult to see how we could be sure what
individuals lacked the requisite hereditary capacity. Galton’s
view that success is a fair test has little following,
and no other test is at hand. I conclude, then, that
the sphere of a scientific eugenics, which shall deliberately
select some types for propagation and reject others,
should probably not extend much beyond the suppression
of clearly marked kinds of degeneracy.</p>

<p class='c010'>It would seem that we must rely for our standards
mainly upon the actual test of social struggle, acting either
through economic misery or through some kind of moral
pressure, in the nature of custom or public opinion,
which shall discourage from raising families those who
do not “make good,” and require a greater fecundity from
those who do.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>In the past we have made use, unconsciously, of misery,
which was rendered the more unjust and indiscriminate
by the fact that those subject to it were held in a lower
class, having little real opportunity to show their fitness
for a higher condition. We seek to do away with this,
not only because of the injustice and indiscrimination,
but also because degradation impairs the whole state of
society. At the same time we must admit the possibility
that we may make a bad situation worse by abolishing
the only selective agent we have.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our chief reliance, apparently, must be upon substituting
custom and social pressure for misery in restricting
the propagation of those who cannot maintain their families
at a normal standard of living. Experience seems
to show that the voluntary check easily comes into operation
along with the growth of intelligence and social ambition—so
easily that it is already carried to excess by
the well-to-do in most countries, and in at least one
country—France—by the bulk of the people. It appears
not at all Utopian to think that this mild and indirect
check may in time not only take the place of destructive
misery, but prove more effective as a method of selection.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile we have a difficult problem in that class of
people who are poor stock, but not so definitely degenerate
that it is practicable to interfere and prevent their propagation.
Almost every village has such a problem in the
irresponsible procreation of families whom the community
knows to be incompetent. I have received trustworthy
accounts of many such from students.</p>

<p class='c013'>It will appear to some that the whole plan of improvement
breaks down at this point through the inadequacy
of social pressure to limit natural increase. But we have
come a long way since Malthus, and in a general view of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>the situation it appears probable, though not demonstrable,
that social pressure will more and more meet
the problem. A reasonable view of irresponsible procreation
is that it is confined chiefly to those families
which, through neglect, have not learned to feel the
cogency of higher standards of life, and that the best
way to deal with it is to make those standards universal.
To fall back upon misery and vice for elimination would
probably, by increasing irresponsibility, make matters
worse rather than better. In other words, while the plan
of dealing with the whole situation by opportunity, standards,
and moral control is not free from difficulties, it is
more promising, even at its weakest point, than a policy
of neglect.</p>

SYNTHESIS</p>

<p class='c010'>The process of life is an organic whole every part of
which is interdependent with every other part. And it
is all a struggle of some sort—with climate and soil, between
persons, nations, or other groups, or among opposing
ideas and institutions. In this strenuous whole, group
conflict plays a great part, but it is by no means the
whole process, nor can the latter be understood from this
point of view alone.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is a wide-spread doctrine, a sort of simplified and
misunderstood Darwinism, which unduly exalts conflict
and makes the “struggle for existence” between groups
almost the sole principle of human life. In the form of
what may be called state-conflict particularism this idea
has had a considerable influence on recent history, through
influencing, largely, the policy of the German Empire,
and leading up to the Great War.</p>

<p class='c013'>The evolution or progress of nations, according to this
teaching, takes place through a struggle for existence
among the contending states, in which the strongest and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>best survive, and impose their institutions on others.
This makes for the general good of mankind, because it
is the only way by which better forms of life can supplant
the inferior. Might is based on right and is the proof of
it, since there is no kind of virtue that does not count
in the supreme test of war.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus the theory singles out the conflict of states from
the rest of the process, saying: “Here is the one thing
needful; let us put our whole energy into this; nothing
else really counts.” Everything is bent toward national
power in the form of armaments and of militant industry
and trade—institutions, literature, art, research, education,
family life, the every-day thought and sentiment of
the people, all are enlisted and drilled.</p>

<p class='c013'>It follows, moreover, that all morality is secondary to
that success of the state which is the supreme good.
Where this is concerned scruples are but weakness, and
any method is right that gets results. Weak nations
cumber the earth and ought to succumb to strong ones.
Their ruin is painful, but salutary, even to themselves in
the long run, for the conquerors will make amends by incorporating
them into their own better system.</p>

<p class='c013'>Under this creed a formidable organism is built up
which may win in war and peace, and thrive for generations,
but is doomed to fail sooner or later because it is
adapted to only a part of life, and not to the whole process.
It neglects the dependence of nations upon one another,
and upon civilization as a whole. Its trend to force and
to national egoism presently alienates other states and
prepares a hostile combination. The outraged principle
of moral unity reacts by imposing moral isolation, with
the external antagonism and inward degeneration which
that involves. The community of nations being aroused
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>to assert itself against the disloyal member, the theory
proves misleading and action upon it disastrous.</p>

<p class='c010'>And yet we must use special points of view, and that of
group conflict has an advantage in the way it illumines
the general situation. War is not the whole of the drama,
but, in the past at least, it has been the crisis, the test
that brought everything into action and showed what the
previous development had been. Growth goes on for generations
and peaceful struggles of many sorts take place—industrial
rivalry, competition of classes and parties,
conflict of ideas and sentiments—all having important
results, which, however, remain for the most part obscure.
But let a war break out between rival groups and they
summon every element of power to the test, so that we
soon learn where, as regards the development of total
force, we have arrived. It is a partial view, but revealing,
and even the moral elements are more fully displayed
than at other times.</p>

<p class='c010'>The test of war is one that from the dawn of human
life down to the present hour every kind of society, from
time to time, has had to meet. For untold millenniums
of prehistoric development the conflict of tribal groups
was a recurring condition for all types of men and forms
of organization, and those which were unsuited to it
tended to be destroyed or discredited. In every part of
the inhabited world archæologists find evidence that forgotten
peoples have fought the ground over, and succeeded
one another in its occupation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Although we cannot reproduce the process in detail,
it is instructive to ask ourselves what sort of men and of
social structures might be expected to hold their own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>through these millenniums, and so to emerge into recorded
history. We may perceive a variety of requirements,
according as we regard the conditions with reference to
the individuals, considered severally, the family, or the
group as a whole.</p>

<p class='c013'>Individually man must have developed personal prowess—strength,
courage, enterprise, endurance, cunning, and
the like, since a tribe lacking in any of these traits would
be in that degree inferior and liable to be destroyed or
enslaved. And the family group must become such as
to insure the fecundity of the tribe and the early care
of its children; which means good mothers, at least,
and perhaps also some measure of constancy and affection
in the fathers.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the social system as a whole, the great thing is to
achieve effectual team-work. It must inculcate discipline,
loyalty, and industrial and social intelligence in the
members, must embrace an adequate system of communication
for organizing and developing the social mind,
and also a body of special traditions and customs to meet
the exigencies to which the tribe is liable. Stability is a
prime necessity, and needs to be fortified by a conviction
of the sanctity of what comes down from the past; and
yet the system must not be so rigid as to be incapable of
meeting new situations. The “folkways” must become
such as assist, or at least do not greatly hinder, in the
struggles of life. And of course the whole thing hangs
together, individuals, family and social system being inseparable
aspects of an integral whole.</p>

<p class='c013'>The ideas which make up the social order are impressed
upon the member mainly by sheer suggestion;
they form the environment in which he lives. In case
of opposition, however, they must be reinforced by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>pressure of public opinion, by emulation, praise and
blame. <em>Mores</em> are set up and the individual is made to
feel that the great thing in life is to conform to them.
Disloyalty to them is universally abhorred. Thus virtue
is determined by what the mind of the group approves,
which rests, in great part, upon what has been found to
work in the struggles of the group, and especially in war.</p>

<p class='c013'>In these respects the requirements of primitive conflict
were not essentially different from those of to-day. Life
was simpler, cruder, and on a smaller scale, but the main
elements were much the same—biological and social continuity,
adaptive growth, individual exertion, and institutional
discipline. There was no riot of irresponsible
brute force, but then as now the man fit to survive was a
moral man, a “good” man in his relation to the life of
the group—devoted, law-abiding, and kindly, as well as
strong and bold.</p>

<p class='c010'>The influence of group conflict, actual or anticipated,
upon social development has continued in full vigor
throughout history and down to the present time. The
growth of states in size and internal structure, as civilization
progresses, is natural on other grounds, but has been
immensely stimulated and directed by military requirements.
France, England, Germany—all the great modern
nations, including the United States—were consolidated
largely in this way. It is a commonplace of
history. And the case is much the same with internal
structure. On the continent of Europe, where war has
always been imminent if not present, there are few institutions
which do not bear its stamp. Even general
education arose for its military value as much as for any
other reason.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>The German Empire went beyond other states in adopting
the ideal of national power, attained through an all-embracing
militant organization, as the dominating conception
of life. When the Great War broke out this conception
was so largely justified by military results that
the more “individualistic” nations—at first Great Britain
and later the United States—were forced to adopt it, at
least in part and for the time being, in order to hold their
own; and we saw, accordingly, a growth of centralized
and partly compulsory organization that would have been
impossible in peace. At the same time the weak side of
the state-conflict idea was revealed by Germany’s moral
isolation. We are still in the midst of these changes and
cannot be sure of their outcome, but it is certain that war
has illumined the whole situation and opened a fresh cycle
of growth.</p>

<p class='c010'>The difference between tribal society and the modern
system of life lies mainly in the large-scale organic character
of our whole social process. Formerly we lived in
many small societies the relations among which were comparatively
external and mechanical; now we live in one
great society the parts of which are vitally and consciously
united. The instances of this are familiar—the
world-wide traffic, travel, and interchange of thought;
the universal fashions, the international markets, the co-operation
in science and in humanitarian movements.
This is that modern solidarity, so wonderfully increased
within the memory of living men, which makes the understanding
of our life a new problem.</p>

<p class='c013'>The process is still one of struggle—we have no reason
to expect anything else—but the forms of struggle take
on a scale commensurate with the new system of life, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>are conditioned and limited by the closer interdependence
that has come to exist. The competitions of trade are
for world-markets; races are unloosed from their ancient
seats and encounter one another in all parts of the earth;
and if a war comes the solidarity of life tends to draw
many nations into it, and to make it in all respects more
calamitous than war could have been at an earlier period.</p>

<p class='c013'>But along with this growth in the scale of conflict we
have a complication which makes it something essentially
different from a mere enlargement of the struggles of
primitive tribes. Groups have become multiform and
intersecting, so that the national competition which succeeds
to the tribal is only one of a vast system of interactions.
There are groups of every size, from two or
three persons up to millions; their purposes are countless,
their methods equally so. We can no longer see mankind
as broken up into distinct wholes struggling for similar
ends in a similar manner; we see many systems of struggle
which interpenetrate one another, the same men taking
part in various systems, so that the lines of alliance and
opposition are inextricably entangled. Modern life,
even when viewed as conflict, is an organic whole which
it is impossible to break up into fragments.</p>

<p class='c010'>Group struggle has, on the whole, tended to rise to
higher levels of intelligence and moral control in accordance
with the increasing mental and moral unification of
life. History shows a general growth of rational organization;
and this means, for one thing, a general situation
in which intelligence and the control of the part in the
interest of the whole more and more condition every kind
of success. International struggles are affected by this
trend, as are all other kinds. Special associations which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>cross national lines, such as those of commerce, labor,
science and philanthropy, increase, and so also do the informal
bonds of literature, art and public sentiment. It
is more and more apparent that the national bond is only
one, though in some respects the most important one, in
a growing network of relations.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is the nature of solidarity to react upon and control
destructive forms of activity. In so far as life is organic
a harm done to the part comes to be a harm done to the
whole, and to be felt as such. If it is true that common
interests of some kind unite every sort of men with every
other, then it is no longer possible to divide man into
separate and merely hostile wholes. There was never
before so much to lose by an outbreak of violence, and we
have seen how a modern war can become a world-calamity,
arousing a universal determination to prevent
its repetition. And although this may prove ineffectual
and war may recur, it must be true, if man has power
over his own destiny, that it is, on the whole, obsolescent.
The principle applies also to international or interracial
bad faith or ill will. It is not too much to say that the
whole world is becoming one body, so that evil appearing
in one part is felt as a menace to all the others.</p>

<p class='c010'>Intimately bound up with the growth of rational control
is the trend toward democracy, in the sense of an
active participation of the common people in the social
process. Our modern communication, with its implications
of popular discussion and education, is essentially
democratic; it means that the people are in reality participating,
whether formally so or not. I cannot affirm
with any confidence that all peoples are to have deliberative
self-government, as that is understood in England or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>America; democracy will be different for different races
and traditions. But everywhere, I conceive, there is
coming to be a public mind, a vital psychic whole, and the
government, whatever its precise methods, will be essentially
the expression of this.</p>

<p class='c013'>This emergence of the popular mind involves also a
tendency to humanism, in the sense of bringing all forms
of life under the control of humane ideals springing from
the family and community groups in which the people
are nurtured. These primary ideals have been kept under
in the past by the need of harsh forms of control, the
prevalence of war, the domination of classes and the severity
of economic conditions; but all signs indicate that
they are to have an increasing part in the future.</p>

<p class='c010'>This modern enlargement and complication imply a
kind of differentiation of the person from the group.
In primitive society membership is intimate and inclusive,
the individual putting his whole personality into it.
But as groups become numerous and complex there comes
to be a kind of parcelling out of personal activities into
somewhat impersonal functions, with special associates
in each function. A person, while as much dependent
as ever upon the group system as a whole, grows less and
less identified with any one group. His relations become
selective, each man working out for himself a system of
life different from that of any other man, and not embraced
in any one set of connections. Personality becomes
more and more an organization by itself, distinct from
that of any group, and forming itself by a special choice
of influences. You cannot sum up the social environment
and mental outlook of a man of to-day by saying
that he is a farmer, or an artisan, or a priest, as you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>might have done in the Middle Ages. He may be a
farmer and also many other things; a member of learned
societies, an investor in remote enterprises, a socialist, a
poet; in short, a complex and unique personality.</p>

<p class='c013'>We are coming more and more to base our social order
upon this selective association. In accordance with the
ideal of “equal opportunity,” we try to facilitate special
personal development in every possible way, holding that
it not only does the most for the individual, but enables
him to do the most for society. In this way modern society
recognizes and fosters individuality as the earlier
epochs never thought of doing.</p>

<p class='c010'>These conditions involve another of great practical interest,
namely, that the division of groups in modern life
is, for the most part, not a division of persons. I mean
that although you may classify the population, for example,
as Republicans, Democrats, Progressives, and
Socialists, there are no separate groups of whole persons
corresponding to these distinctions. Although A may
be a Republican and B a Democrat, and their differences
in this field may be quite irreconcilable, they may yet
belong to the same church, club, stock company, even to
the same family. Only a small part of them is separable
on the political line, and so with any other group line.
To put it otherwise, there is no such specialization of life
into narrow classes as you might infer from the large
number of special groups, since these are not groups of
whole persons, but of interests, activities, opinions, or
what-not, many of which meet in a single person. The
whole system is more intricately unified, as well as more
intricately specialized, than was formerly the case.</p>

<p class='c013'>The inclusive, essentially personal, groups persist to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>some extent, the chief example being the family. But I
need hardly point out that even the family is far less an
inclusive group than it used to be; that it no longer absorbs
the individual’s political status in its own, that it
does not control the marriages of its children or transmit
occupations, that it has abandoned many of its economic
and educational functions, and has become, in short, a
comparatively specialized group whose main functions are
sociability and the nurture of young children. Nowhere
more clearly than in the family can we see the disintegrating
effect of the modern order upon any form of association
which conflicts with selective personal development.</p>

<p class='c013'>In view of all this we see that the group struggles of
modern life must be more and more impersonal, conflicts
of ideas rather than of people. Perhaps the way to test
the matter is to ask ourselves how many of the group
struggles in which we are concerned are of a nature to
make us feel that the men in the opposing groups are
our enemies. Even in war we do not always have this
feeling: we have become conscious of too many bonds of
sympathy with the people of other countries. And in
every-day life we contend a great deal, but for the most
part impersonally. If we hate anybody it is more likely
to be a matter of natural antipathy than of social opposition.</p>

<p class='c010'>And yet personality must be put into special enterprises
in some way, or they will fail. They require for
success a kind of interest and devotion that can come only
from persons who do identify themselves with the group.
I may buy stock in a company and draw dividends without
putting myself into the work, but I could not do this
unless others did put themselves into it.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>The result of this requirement, working alongside of the
depersonalizing tendency just mentioned, has been to
make the characteristic form of modern organization what
I may call the nucleated group, a group, that is, composed
of a large number of members who put very little of
themselves into it, along with a few, or perhaps only one,
who enlist the main part of their personality. This gives
a happy union of breadth and concentration, and if one
will reflect upon the associations to which he belongs he
will find, I imagine, that nearly all are conducted in this
way. It is the only way to meet the demand for multifarious
co-operation and specialization which modern life
makes.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is worth noting that the individual is nucleated as
well as the group. That is, he spreads his life out over
many groups, but yet concentrates his central personality
upon two or three. A teacher, for example, may
own stock in several companies and belong to a number
of scientific, philanthropic and recreative associations,
but after all he lives mainly in his teaching and his family.</p>

<p class='c013'>This concentration is agreeable to human nature,
which craves devotion to a cause. Life is energized by
men throwing themselves into some one of its innumerable
purposes, making themselves the blazing head of that
particular comet while the rest of us gleam palely in the
tail. In this way scientific theories, educational reforms,
and business “propositions” are promoted with a personal
ardor which reacts with antagonism to whatever
opposes its object.</p>

<p class='c010'>It might seem that patriotism must play a diminishing
part in modern life, under the principle that personality
is less and less embraced in any one group, even though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>that group be the nation. There is reason to think,
however, that the need of devotion to a whole and of
self-abandonment, at times, to some sort of mass enthusiasm,
is a trait of human nature too strong to be overcome
by the growing complexity of life. Like the love
of the sexes, it is something elemental, without which life
is felt to be baffled and incomplete. There is a deep
need to merge the “I” in a “We,” some vast “We,” on
which one may float as on a flood of larger life. The ordinary
ambitions and specialties do not satisfy this need,
which is certainly a large part of the real religion of mankind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Collective emotion of this sort is always smouldering
within us, and may at any time break forth and melt
into some kind of a whole the differentiations of which
our life appears to consist. It evidently does so in times
of warlike excitement, and may well give rise to other
forms of enthusiasm which we cannot now foresee. It
produced the Crusades in the past, and may produce
future movements equally remote from our recent experience.</p>

<p class='c010'>The modern world makes distracting claims upon us.
Shall we go with our family and class, or break away in
pursuit of a larger humanitarian ideal? Is it better to
“mind our own business” and go in for technical excellence,
or to try for culture? Shall we follow the morals
of our church or those of our profession? Shall we be
national patriots or international socialists?</p>

<p class='c013'>There is no way out but to strive for a synthesis of
these ideas in an organic whole, in some supreme and inclusive
allegiance, perhaps in some conception of a God
to whom one may look for leadership above the divisions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>of nation, race, and sect. So long as we are conscious
only of our country, our family, our class, or our business,
we may make a kind of god of that, but conflicting ideals
force us to seek a larger unity. In the heat of war we
may be all one flame of patriotism; but after a while the
rest of life asserts itself, and we ask what we are fighting
for, demanding that it be something for the good of
all mankind.</p>

<p class='c010'>What ground have we for hoping that a society of
nations has become possible in our time, when all previous
history shows failure to attain it? Mankind has always
cherished this aspiration, and if it is at last to be realized,
there must be some general change in conditions, making
practicable what has heretofore been merely visionary.
I wish, therefore, to recall certain developments in the
social situation which have taken place during the past
century and seem to me to justify our belief that the
problem of international order may be not far from solution.
They are in the nature of a general growth in that
organization of human life of which international order
is but one phase.</p>

<p class='c013'>I may note first that there has been a revolutionary
change in the social mechanism. The means of communication
have been transformed, enlarging and animating
social relations and making possible, so far as
mechanism is concerned, any degree or kind of unity
that we may be able to achieve. In this respect alone
we have a new world since the failure of Prince Metternich’s
scheme of pacification after the Napoleonic Wars.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>The second change is the growth, and what appears to
be the establishment of nationality as the principle animating
those members of which a world-organism must
be composed. This change is bound up with the preceding,
since nations are masses of men united by language,
literature, tradition, and local associations, and
it is through the growth of communication that they
have come to feel their unity more and more and to demand
expression for it in a political whole.</p>

<p class='c013'>I know there are some who hold that the national spirit
is hostile to world-organization, and who picture the
present state of things as a struggle between nationalism,
on the one hand, and a higher principle, such as internationalism,
fraternalism, or socialism, on the other. It
seems, however, that, although the national spirit must
be chastened and regenerated before it is fit for the larger
order, there is no possibility of dispensing with it. Sound
theory calls for a type of organism intermediate between
the individual or the family and the world-whole which
we hope to see arise.</p>

<p class='c013'>A ripe nationality is favorable to international order
for the same reason that a ripe individuality is favorable
to order in a small group. It means that we have coherent,
self-conscious, and more or less self-controlled elements
out of which to build our system. To destroy nationality
because it causes wars would be like killing people
to get rid of their selfishness. Our selves are poor
things, but they are all we have, and so with nations in
the larger whole. So far as the world is nationalized it
is organized up to the point where supernationalism must
begin. Having achieved the substructure, we are ready
to add the upper stories. We seek a synthesis, and anything
synthetic already achieved and not hopelessly unavailable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>is so much gain. It is only too obvious that,
on account of their incoherence, those regions where a
national consciousness has not yet developed are a peril
to any system we may erect. The national state, supported
by patriotism, is our central disciplinary institution,
the backbone of historical structure, which could
decay only at the cost of a vast collapse and disintegration
involving the degradation of human character.
Even intermittent war would be better than this.</p>

<p class='c013'>And just as it takes ambitious and self-assertive persons
to make a vigorous group, so we need national emulation
and struggle in a greater society. A world-life
that was altogether supernational, without aggressive
differentiation, would, I believe, be enervating, and I
agree with the militarists in so far as to find this an unsatisfying
ideal. We sometimes think of the Commonwealth
of Man as likely to resemble the United States
on a greater scale; but it would not be well to have the
nations of the world so much alike, or even so harmonious,
as our States; nor is it likely that they will be. We need
a more energetic difference.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another favoring change is the rise of democracy.
This has been contemporaneous with the rise of nationalism,
and is likewise based upon the new communication
and education that have made it possible to organize
social consciousness on a great scale. Indeed nationalism
and democracy, although they may at times conflict,
are phases of the same development. In both the individual
gets a congenial sphere of expression. The people,
awakened by the new intercourse, are no longer inert and
indifferent to the larger relations of life, but live more in
these relations and aspire to feel themselves members
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>of great sympathetic wholes. They find these in democratic
groups united by the spiritual bonds of language,
ideal, and tradition; and strive, accordingly, to make the
actual organization correspond to such groups.</p>

<p class='c013'>The view that democracy will insure international
peace is, in my opinion, not so certainly true as many
think. It is not impossible that a whole nation may become
possessed by military ideals and passions, as has at
times been measurably true of France. And democracy
affords no guarantee that an energetic militant faction,
even though a minority, may not grasp the lead and rush
a nation into war. Something of this kind took place in
the Southern States at the outbreak of the rebellion.
Would the world-war have been impossible if Germany
had been as democratically organized as France? I do
not see that it would, though it must, no doubt, have
come on in a different way. The conflict of ideas and
ambitions would still have been there, with no adequate
way to settle it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet there are practical reasons for thinking that democracy,
on the whole, will be pacific. It gives power to the
masses, who are the chief sufferers from war and normally
the most kindly in sentiment. Homely and friendly
ideals of life have always had their stronghold among the
common people, and war has been fostered mainly by
rulers and upper classes, not merely for aggrandizement,
but as a kind of sport to which they were addicted for
its own sake. It may safely be assumed that modern
democracy will not share this taste, but, although still
subject to martial excitement, will pursue, in the main,
ideals more likely to promote every-day happiness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another reason why democracy tends to international
peace is that under modern conditions it is necessary for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>content and equilibrium within a nation. One of the
main causes of recent wars has been the need of sovereigns
and ruling classes to forestall internal revolution
by the pressure of external conflict. Napoleon III, not
only once but several times, sought war in the hope of
supporting his power by the prestige of victory, and there
is reason to believe that Russia, Germany, and Austria
were all influenced by this motive in the year 1914. Extending
radicalism was threatening to split these countries,
and it was felt that conflict without would close the rift
within. We all know how true, for the time at least,
this proved to be.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a fourth of these general changes favorable to the
prospect of enduring peace, I would reckon the diffusion
of organizing capacity among the people, not only by
education and political democracy, but quite as much
through economic experience. The administration of
business in its innumerable branches and the participation
in labor-unions and other economic groups have developed
on a great scale that power of the individual to
understand and create social machinery which is essential
to any well-knit organization. The industrial nations,
at least, are equipped with all kinds and degrees of organizing
ability, and if they do not organize peace it
will be because they do not want to.</p>

<p class='c010'>The changes I have mentioned may all be summed up
in the statement that the world has been taking on a
larger and higher organization, which now demands expression
in the international sphere. There is no doubt
of the preparation, and the time seems fully ripe for
achievement.</p>

<p class='c013'>And, finally, we have the lessons of the Great War.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>I am far from presuming to expound these, but it is certain
that there is scarcely anything in the way of social
ideas and institutions that has not been tested and developed.
We know the extent and disaster of modern war
as we could not before, and a fierce light has been cast
upon all its antecedents.</p>

<p class='c013'>We hold that the war must establish at least one
great principle, fundamental to any tolerable plan of
peace, namely, that no nation, however powerful, can
hope to thrive by power alone, without the good-will of
its neighbors. From this point of view the main purpose
of the war is to vindicate the moral unity of mankind
against self-assertion. We are resolved that it shall
register the defeat of self-sufficiency and domination, and
so point the way to an international group within which
national struggle can go on under general control.</p>

<p class='c010'>Assuming that the general conditions have become
favorable, I wish further to inquire whether it is reasonable
to expect that a society of nations may be formed
upon the same principles that we rely upon in the association
of individuals. How far is a group of nations like
a group of persons? Can we anticipate that the members
will be guided, for better or worse, by the ordinary impulses
of human nature, or must we have a new psychology
for them?</p>

<p class='c013'>Whether the behavior of a social whole will be personal
or not depends upon whether the members identify themselves
heartily with it. If they do, then, in times of
aroused feeling, those sentiments and passions which are
similar in all men and are easily communicated will inflame
the whole group and be expressed in its behavior.
It will act personally in the sense that it is ruled by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>live impulses of human nature and not by mere routine
or special interest. Most groups are far from answering
to this description, which, as a rule, applies only to those
that are small and intimate, like the family. But the
case of the nation is peculiar, since it is known to evoke
the emotion of patriotism, which has a special power to
draw into itself the whole force of personality.</p>

<p class='c013'>The psychological background of patriotism I take to
be the need of human nature to escape from the limitations
of individuality and to immerse the spirit in something
felt to be larger, nobler, and more enduring. This
need is expressed also in devotion to leaders, like Napoleon
or Garibaldi; in the passion for causes, like socialism
and the labor movement, and in many forms of religious
service. Its main object in our time, however, is one’s
country; and it is because of the wholeness with which
men put themselves into it that a nation comes to have a
collective self in which such sentiments as pride, resentment,
and aspiration are fully alive. A self-conscious
nation is a true <em>socius</em>, and consequently may unite with
others in a social and moral group. The whole doctrine
of international relations might well start from this point,
that the units with which we deal are truly human and
not mere corporations or sovereignties.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is true that their relations have been mostly selfish
or hostile in the past, but this is true also of persons except
in so far as, by working together, they have acquired
habits and sentiments of co-operation. And nations,
even in their conflicts, confess their unity by seeking one
another’s admiration. Each wants to distinguish itself
in the eyes of the international audience, and war itself
is waged largely from this motive. We wish our country
to be glorious, to excel in the world-game; and the fact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>that the game is destructive does not destroy the social
character of the impulse. If this were not present, we
should not find our leaders instigating us by appeals to
national honor, resentment, and pride. Perhaps there is
no better proof of the personal nature of national feeling
than the large part which “insults” play in arousing it.
An entity that can be insulted is essentially human.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the national spirit is truly human and social it should
be capable of a moral development and of participating
in a moral order similar to that which prevails in personal
relations. And perhaps the surest proof that international
social control is possible is that nations have shown
themselves capable of feeling and acting upon a sympathetic
indignation at aggression upon other nations, as
in the case of Belgium. Such indignation is in all societies
the most active impulse making for the enforcement of
justice. There is an incredible doctrine taught by some
writers that the national self can feel greed and hate,
but cannot rise to justice, friendship, and magnanimity.
Why should its human nature be so one-sided? Is it not
quite conceivable that we might come to demand an
even higher standard of honor and conduct from our
country than we do from ourselves, because the idea of
country, like the idea of God, is the symbol of a higher
kind of life? The gods have been in the mud too, and
as they have risen from it to an ethical plane we may hope
the same of the nations.</p>

<p class='c013'>If this view is sound, it follows that if we can change
the ruling ideal so that nations come to admire one another
for being righteous, magnanimous, and just, as well
as strong and successful, we shall find them as eager to
live up to <em>this</em> ideal as they now are to conform to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>lower one. It is all a matter of the standards of the
group.</p>

<p class='c013'>If there is a nation that has deliberately set out to be
unsocial by adopting a theory of national aggrandizement
by <i><span lang="de">Macht</span></i> alone, that nation is believed to be Germany;
but even here, however unlovely the resulting
type of self may appear to be, there can be little doubt
that it is a social self, ambitious to shine in the eyes of
the world. Strange as we may think it, the self-conscious
part of Germany felt that she was doing a glorious thing
when in 1914 she assailed two great nations and defied
a third; and she looked confidently to others for admiration.
Perhaps we may expect that, having learned where
she misjudged the sentiment of the group, she will in the
future conduct herself in a manner more acceptable to it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nations, then, are normally moral agents, subject to
control by the ruling opinion of the period as to what is
honorable and praiseworthy. The trouble has been, in
great part, that this ruling opinion has set barbaric standards
and approved a style of conduct such as prevails
among savage tribes or lawless frontiersmen in a new
country. A nation was held to be great in proportion as
it extended its possessions, its rule, and the dread of its
arms. The expression “national honor” in the history
of the nineteenth century will be found to mean chiefly
warlike prestige, a reputation for valor and success, the
power to punish enemies or reward friends. It was sullied
by failure to take revenge, by declining a challenge
or deserting an ally, but not by lawlessness, arrogance, or
greed. The ideal from which honor took its meaning
was national prowess, not the welfare of a group of nations;
there was no reference to a general right springing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>from organic unity. It was the honor of Achilles or Rob
Roy, not the team-work honor of a modern soldier.</p>

<p class='c013'>Temporary peace was obtained by a balance of power,
that is, not by any real unity, but by the clans being so
nearly matched that each hesitated to start a fight.
Such hesitation might be expedient, but it was not in
itself honorable. Honor was to be won mainly by victorious
conflict, on no matter what occasion, and by displaying
the power which followed. Napoleon shone in
this way and dazzled all Europe, including Goethe, who
was in many things the wisest man of his time. His
nephew tried to do the same and had no lack of honor so
long as he seemed to succeed. Bismarck did succeed,
and the German Empire became the standard-bearer of
this type of honor, continuing to uphold it after it had
been partly abandoned by other nations.</p>

<p class='c013'>The organic unity of Europe, real as it had become, was
slow to transform national idealism, and diplomacy as
well as war remained a game for mutual injury and humiliation.
England, which was in a position to lead the
way, took some steps in a better path, but not enough to
convince the world. The old ways were too strong upon
her; she upheld Turkey and crushed the Boer republics,
giving an indifferent example to Germany, whose imperialism
is largely an imitation, however distorted, of
that of England. The accepted ideal continued to be
one which implied war, open or covert, as the road to
honor and success.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is clear that this ideal is no longer congruous, as it
once was, with the general state of the world, but is a
pernicious survival, unfit, unevolutionary, and ripe for
elimination. The obstacles to this are institutional, not
inherent in human nature, and if the momentum of custom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>and the glamour of honor can be transferred from the
ways of war to those of peace, the hardest of the work
will be done.</p>

<p class='c010'>The logical outcome is an organic international life, in
which each nation and each national patriotism will be
united, but not lost, as individuals are united in an intimate
group. Our national individuality will subsist,
but will derive its guidance and meaning from its relation
to the common whole, finding its ambition, emulation
and honor in serving that, as a boy does in the play
group or a soldier in his regiment. A spirit of team-work
will be substituted, we may hope, for that of unchastened
self-assertion. There will be rivalry, not always of the
highest kind, and even war may be possible until we have
worked out the rules of the game and the means of applying
them, but the moral whole will assert itself with increasing
power. The new system means bringing the
national state under social discipline, making it a responsible
member of a larger society. Its significance is
not to diminish, but to become of a somewhat different
kind, like that of a woman when she marries. Hitherto
not Germany alone but all the nations have clung to an
individualism incompatible with any permanent international
order and with any discipline except force.</p>

<p class='c013'>I do not look for any disappearance of national selfishness,
even of the grosser kinds. Human nature has various
moods, most of them unedifying, and the every-day
grumbling, quarrelling routine of life will no doubt go on
among nations as among individuals. But in spite of
this we have idealism and a social order among persons,
and we may expect that nations will have them also.
We must organize both ideals and selfish interest, so that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>the former may work with as little friction on account of
the latter as possible. Fundamentally both depend for
their gratification upon a social order.</p>

<p class='c013'>The unity of the international whole will be of a different
quality from that of the nation. It will be less intimate
and passionate and will lack the bond of emulation
and conflict with other wholes like itself. There is a
kind of conflict, however, which even an all-inclusive
whole must undergo, namely, that with rebellious elements
within itself, and this struggle for unity will enhance
self-consciousness, as the Civil War did for the
United States. The league of nations will not be merely
utilitarian, though its utility will be immense, but will
appeal more and more to the imagination by the grandeur
of its ideal and the sacrifices necessary to attain it; and,
as it achieves concrete existence in institutions, symbols,
literature, and art, human thought and sentiment will
find a home in it. And just as patriotism is akin to the
more militant and evangelistic type of religion, so international
consciousness corresponds to religious feeling of
a quieter and more universal sort, to the idea of a God
in whom all nations and sects find a various unity.</p>

<p class='c010'>I realize something of the immense importance and
difficulty of the economic and political problems involved
with the question of an international social order, which
I must leave to abler hands. We must do our best to
provide equal economic opportunity for all nations, to
establish at least the beginnings of an international constitution,
with judicial, legislative, and executive branches,
and also to provide a process of orderly change by which
the world may assimilate new conditions and thus avoid
fresh disaster. I think, however, that all these questions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>need to be dealt with in view of the more general social
problem. We shall not have an international society unless
we have political and economic justice; but neither
can these endure except as the fruits of a real international
solidarity.</p>

<p class='c013'>We are likely to overestimate the part that force can
play in keeping international order. It will, no doubt,
be necessary, especially at first, to have a reserve of force
to impress the less civilized nations, and possibly the more
civilized at times of exceptional tension. But our discipline
will fail, as it does in schools and families, unless
we can get good-will to support it. Force cannot succeed
except as the expression of general sentiment, and if we
have that it will rarely be necessary. To exalt it by
brandishing a club is to exalt an idea whose natural issue
is war. A single powerful nation, whose heart remains
hostile to the system, will probably be able to defeat it,
and certainly will prevent its developing any spirit higher
than that of a policeman. The Commonwealth of Man
must have force, but must mainly be based on something
higher; on tolerance, understanding, common ideals,
common interests, and common work.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXIV<br> <span class='c011'>CLASS AND RACE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>THE CLASS-CONFLICT THEORY CRITICISED—ECONOMIC SOLIDARITY OF
CLASSES—THE OUTLOOK—RACE; HEREDITARY AND SOCIAL FACTORS—WHAT
CONSTITUTES, PRACTICALLY, A RACE PROBLEM—RACE
IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS—MINGLING RACES; RACE
CASTE</p>

<p class='c010'>Class-conflict thinkers have conceived the social
situation somewhat as follows: There are practically two
classes, the privileged and the unprivileged. They are
separate and irreconcilable and the rift between them is
growing wider. So soon as they clearly grasp this situation
the unprivileged, who are far more numerous and
of equal natural ability, will overcome the privileged and
bring about a revolution. This will obliterate the class
line and permit the organization of a classless and purely
democratic society.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is more in accord with the facts, I think, to hold
that these divisions, in American democracy at least,
are subject to that principle of modern life which keeps
the person from being absorbed in the group, insures his
being a member of the organic whole as well as of a faction,
and makes social classes more and more like parties
rather than distinct organisms. Moreover, as parties,
they probably have a permanent function, and are not
likely to be obliterated.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fact that we all live in a common stream of suggestion
and discussion makes a total separation of classes
impossible. Capitalists and hand-workers read, in great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>part, the same newspaper despatches and public speeches.
There is a common general atmosphere which no man
interested in his fellows can escape. Wars, calamities,
adventures, athletic contests, heroic deeds, pathetic incidents,
inventions, discoveries, and the like appeal to everybody,
and make a common element into which class feeling
enters very little. There are, of course, class publications
which often emphasize to the utmost the class view
of every occurrence; but few intelligent men are content
with these alone. We all love the broad current and seek
it in the press. It seems that this is more the case now
than formerly; that men are less and less content with the
committed organs of any sort of opinion, but demand a
large and free view.</p>

<p class='c013'>If the question of the moment happens to be a class
question, the modern way of treating it is by open discussion,
in which each side strives to understand the other’s
point of view, if only to refute it. This inestimable good
has democracy brought us, among others, that we dare
not, cannot, ignore the other side; we must meet it in
open discussion. This, again, is a growing condition. All
who can remember twenty-five or thirty years back must
be impressed with the tendency of everything to come
into the open. Formerly the domination of the rich was
a covert thing, very little being said about it because it
was unobserved, or accepted as part of the natural order.
And the like was true of a hundred other questionable
or vicious conditions—political corruption, sexual vice, and
the like. At present the interest and intelligence directed
toward class questions is too great to permit of underhand
or secretive methods. Wrongs are brought to light
sooner or later and react against those who practise them.
It would be hard to say whether labor has been most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>hurt by venality and intimidation on the part of some of
its leaders, or capital by its corruption of politics and exploitation
of the people. Public opinion regards both
with deep resentment, and is determined to know the
truth regarding them.</p>

<p class='c013'>And when two parties are brought to discuss an issue
before the public as arbiter, they are in great degree reconciled
or united by the process. That is, they are
brought to recognize and appeal to common principles
of justice which the public accepts as binding on all.
The airing of fundamental economic questions in our day
is educative to all concerned. The tendency of it is to
draw our ideas and practices out of the dimness of a class
environment and show them in the white light of the
public square, where every passer-by is a critic; so that
we ourselves are led to take a universal view of them.</p>

<p class='c013'>This would be true even if there were no authoritative
expression of public opinion in government, but it is all
the more true because there is such an expression. It is
an excellent thing, as regards solidarity, that every faction
must stand well with the public under peril of hostile
regulation. This means, if only we can make the
public mind penetrating and intelligent, that it will not
pay to do the things that cannot bear the light.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those who doubt our ability to control the capitalist
class perhaps give too little weight to the moral elements
in the situation. The privileged classes of the past have
been strong because they were, or seemed to be, essential
to social order and the maintenance of the higher traditions.
If their function in this regard is diminishing, as
there is reason to think, then the moral position of any
class attempting to continue the old inequalities as against
practicable reforms, will be extremely weak. No merely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>selfish interest, under modern conditions, can long make
head against the general current of moral judgment.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is true that class loyalty may, to some extent, enlist
a spirit of group devotion and militant ardor; but it does
not, for the majority offer the conditions needed to awake
enthusiasm, and I do not see how it ever can. Social
classes, make what you will of them, have not separate
cultures, traditions, or currents of daily thought, and are
not likely to have. The class spirit has not been successful
in subordinating the spirit of nationality, even in time
of peace; while in time of war, or in the case of nationalities
struggling with oppression, like the Belgians, the
Poles, or the Bohemians, class becomes quite a secondary
matter.<a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c014'><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The growing economic solidarity of classes tends in the
same direction. We hear it said with equal confidence
that the interests of capital and labor are opposed, and
that they are the same. The solution, of course, is that
both statements are true. The two have a common interest
in the prosperity and stability of industry, and are
mutually dependent upon each other’s efficiency and fair
dealing. At the same time there is a real conflict of pecuniary
interest as to the division of the product. In
general the solidarity and interdependence increase as
industries become more extensive and intricate, and require
more intelligent and harmonious co-operation. It
is also increased by the diffusion of investment, thrifty
wage-earners becoming, to a large and increasing degree,
small capitalists as well. The outcome is an organic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>whole which does not exclude opposition, but tends to
limit it to what is functional, and to bring it under the
control of rule.</p>

<p class='c013'>Under such conditions the relation between economic
classes—capital and labor, let us say, for simplicity—is
that of two parties to a bargain so advantageous for both
that neither can afford to throw it up, but whose precise
terms are matter for controversy. Each side may have
a motive for disputing, for feeling out the other’s position,
even for temporarily refusing to trade, but not for going
to extremes. Neither can afford to push the other to
desperation. Capital could starve out labor, and labor
could wreck the whole system, but in either case it would
be suicidal to do so.</p>

<p class='c013'>The orderly development of industrial life calls for an
organization of process analogous to that of political
democracy; that is, one providing regular methods for investigation,
discussion, conflict, decision, and tentative
advance on the chosen course. Disputes between capital
and labor are normal, and it should be part of our system
to arrange for their development and solution with the
least possible misunderstanding, hostility, and economic
waste. Small differences may be aired and adjusted before
a permanent committee made up from both parties,
while more serious differences, involving principles, after
being formulated by each side, may be precisely and
thoroughly investigated by a public agency in which both
sides have confidence, in order that the situation may be
clearly seen and agreement reached, if possible. And
where struggle proves inevitable it should take place
under public control and in accordance with rules expressing
the paramount ideal of a common service. I understand
something of this kind to be the programme of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>competent students of the labor problem; and there is
the same need of regular process on all lines of growth.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is every reason, in the United States at least, to
anticipate not a class war but a continuance of the comparatively
mild reconnoissances and skirmishes that have
long marked industrial conflicts—whether they are carried
into politics or remain purely industrial. The function
of these light engagements is to determine approximately
the strength of the parties in view of the whole economic,
social, and moral situation, and so to establish a <em>modus
vivendi</em>. Violent or reactionary methods, or any others
not adapted to the general situation, will fail.</p>

<p class='c013'>We may expect gradual but continuous progress in the
direction of ideals of social justice. Such ideals, as they
are diffused, tried out, and adapted, tend to become
standards to which controversies are referred. They
are neither purely humanitarian nor purely economic,
but represent a working compromise between the two.</p>

<p class='c013'>The total-cleavage theory of economic classes is taken
most seriously in Europe, owing to the fact that European
classes are largely castes, an inheritance from an older
order, which actually do embrace almost the whole being
of the member; and also to repressive methods and the
comparative absence of democracy. It would be hard, I
imagine, to find an American writer of equal weight who
would assent to the assertion of the German economic
historian, Karl Bücher, that “all modern industrial development
tends in the direction of producing a permanent
laboring class&#160;... which in future will doubtless
be as firmly attached to the factory as were the servile
laborers of the mediæval manor to the glebe.”<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c014'><sup>[62]</sup></a> I think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>that the division into two classes is on the whole diminishing,
and that while the society of the future will not
be classless, its classes will be mainly functional groups,
increasingly open to all through a democratic and selective
system of education. Class consciousness, however,
is desirable, within limits, as a means to the diminution of
privilege, which still exists in great power and can scarcely
be overcome except as it is understood.</p>

<p class='c010'>The question of race differs from that of nationality or
of social class in that it supposes a division among men
springing not merely from differences in history, environment,
and culture, but rooted in their biological nature.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of such a hereditary division we have almost no <em>definite</em>
knowledge, except as regards the somewhat superficial
traits of color and physiognomy. It is even possible to
doubt whether there is any important innate psychical
difference among the several branches of mankind. It
is certain that different spirits are to be found in different
races, that there is a deep and ancient unlikeness in the
whole inner life of the Japanese, for example, and of the
English. But the same is true of peoples like the English
and German, who are not of distinct races. In other
words, a group soul, a special <em>ethos</em> or <em>mores</em>, is the sure
result of historical causes acting for centuries in a social
system; so that different souls will exist whether the race
is different or not. And as race differences, when present,
are always accompanied by historical differences, it is not
possible to make out just how much is due to them
alone.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many of us, to be sure, feel that the judgment of common
sense, however incapable of demonstration, shows
us unlikenesses of temperament and capacity, between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>Negroes and whites, for example, that cannot altogether
be accounted for by influences acting after birth. Admitting
that color is unimportant, the divergence in cranial
and facial type may reasonably be supposed to
mean <em>something</em>, however unfair may be their interpretation
by white people.</p>

<p class='c013'>It would be strange, reasoning from general principles,
if races which have been bred apart for thousands of
years and, in some cases, have become so different physically,
should remain just alike as to innate mental traits.
Surely it is not in accordance with what we know of heredity
to suppose that millenniums of growth and adaptation
in different environments have no effect upon this most
plastic part of the organism. Or why should races be
presumed equal in mental and moral capacity when
family stocks in the same race are so evidently unequal
in these respects?</p>

<p class='c013'>The next easiest thing to accepting the apparent as
true is to declare it wholly false; and so in regard to
races; if you have come to see that many of the differences
supposed to be racial are due to environment, you
will save yourself trouble by believing that all of them
are of this nature. But I cannot think that a patient
consideration of the facts justifies this conclusion.</p>

<p class='c013'>However, judgments of race capacity are very open to
bias, and have proved so untrustworthy in the past that
it is not surprising that some students regard them as
altogether illusory. Fortunately, it is seldom necessary,
in dealing with practical questions, to depend upon such
judgments.</p>

<p class='c010'>In practice we never have to deal with race as a separate
factor, but always in intimate combination with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>social and historical conditions. The essential thing, for
most purposes, is to understand the working of the combination
as a whole. Accordingly, a race problem, as
understood in practical politics and sociology, does not
mean one based upon a strictly biological distinction, but
one in which biological and social factors, working together,
produce lasting differences sufficient to keep the
groups apart. In Europe most of the cases where there
is an acute race situation—as between Germans and
Poles in northern Prussia, between Russians and Finns,
Germans and Czechs, or English and Irish—are cases
where the strictly biological difference is probably not
very great; the question is mainly one of antagonistic
traditions. In our own Negro problem natural differences
in color and physiognomy certainly play a large
part, if only by defining the race line and instigating
psychological attitudes. What we have to deal with,
in any case, is the total situation.</p>

<p class='c013'>It follows from the importance of environment that
differences which make a race problem in Europe do not
necessarily do so when the peoples in question migrate
to America and undergo in common the assimilating influences
of a democratic civilization. Germans and
Czechs, for example, do not form hostile groups here as
they do in Bohemia. America has demonstrated the
impermanence of many Old World divisions, while others
seem to be as persistent here as anywhere. The only conclusive
test is that of experience.</p>

<p class='c010'>In so far as races remain separate in different nationalities,
with no large or permanent intermigration, it is not
apparent that their relations offer any race problem distinct
from those that attend the contact of nations.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>Thus, as regards international questions, the Americans
and Japanese are simply two nations, like the Americans
and the French. There is no reason why their trade and
diplomacy should be affected by the difference in physiognomy,
and if they should go to war the issue will depend
upon the energy, organization, and intelligence of
the two peoples, precisely as in the case of closely kindred
nations like the English and German. What may be the
basis of the assumption of certain writers that the mere
existence of two races, even with the Pacific between them,
means war, it is not easy to understand. It would seem
that the motives impelling to peace or war would be
about the same as between nations of the same race;
always excepting the possibility that through more intimate
contact by migration racial feeling might be excited
and might extend to the respective nations. I do
not mean to suggest that this last is a very great or an
unavoidable danger, but evidently it is one way, possibly
the only way, in which international relations might take
on a racial character.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another prospect, often brought forward with confidence,
is that if interracial migration is forbidden, the
nation or nations representing the more prolific race will
go to war in order to secure an outlet for their surplus
population. But if they do this they will do it not as
races but as nations; and would do it quite as readily,
perhaps, if there were no difference in race. The nation,
not the race, is the organized militant unit, eager to plant
colonies and extend its power and prestige. The mere
shedding of surplus racial population is not an object of
ambition, and so not in itself likely to be a motive to
war. In other words, it is not apparent why Japan and
China, being peopled by a distinct race, are any more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>likely to attack Canada, in case the latter forbids immigration,
than if they were peopled by Germans or Scandinavians.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another matter whose importance in this connection
is perhaps exaggerated is that of economy of subsistence.
We are told regarding the Japanese that “he can underlive,
and therefore he can outlive, any Occidental,” but I
question whether the unique solidarity of his social system,
intimate, ardent, adaptable, is not a more formidable
element of power than his supposed ability to live on
a cup of rice a day. If the latter is real and advantageous
it is merely a factor in national efficiency, like others,
with no peculiar and inevitable tendency to bring on conflict.</p>

<p class='c010'>It would seem, then, that in order to have a true race
problem the races must mingle in considerable numbers
in the same political system. And in that case the ruling
factor is not the precise amount of strictly racial difference,
as distinct from social, but the actual attitude of
the groups toward each other. If this is such as to keep
them separate and perhaps hostile, it matters little, as
regards the social situation, whether it is based on sound
ethnology or not. In the United States the immigration
of Europeans, even though they be of stocks considerably
different from the older inhabitants, as Italians, Slavs and
Jews, seems not to create a true race problem, experience
indicating that assimilation will take place within a generation
or two. On the other hand, the presence of the
Negro in large numbers creates a race problem, because
assimilation is generally held undesirable, and does not,
in fact, take place. Whether the immigration of Orientals
in large numbers to our Pacific coast would create an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>enduring race question is, perhaps, undetermined, but experience
indicates that it would.</p>

<p class='c013'>Permanent race groups in the same social system constitute
race caste. It seems to me that this is beyond
comparison the most urgent race question with which we
have to deal; not only as regards its present aspects, but
because it is likely to have a rapid growth. Many countries,
including our own, already suffer from it, and the
freedom of movement given by modern conditions, together
with the persistence of race sentiment, tend to
make it almost universal. That is, if the Chinese, for
example, can compete successfully with other races in
certain industrial functions, there is no reason, apart from
legal restriction, why they should not form colonies in
every country where those functions are in demand.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is doubtful how far it may be possible to reconcile
race caste with the democracy and solidarity which are
coming to be the ideals of modern nations. In the
Southern United States the caste feeling is not diminishing,
and while we hope that it is taking on forms more
favorable to the co-operation of the races on a plane of
fair play and mutual respect, the issue is somewhat in
doubt. Certainly the present condition is not in harmony
with democratic ideals, and its defenders can hardly
claim more for it than that it makes the best of a difficult
situation. Much the same appears to be true of the contact
of races in other parts of the world, in South Africa,
Australia, India, and even in Eastern Europe.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a matter of theory a society made up of race groups
co-operating in equality and good-will is not clearly impossible.
But at the best it would be more like an international
federation than like a nation with a single
soul. We can imagine a harmonious Austria-Hungary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>but should not wish our own country to resemble it.
And, as a matter of fact, it has always been the case,
so far as I know, that where there were race castes under
the same government one of them has domineered over
the rest. It is a situation by all means to be avoided if
possible.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are, then, quite apart from any comparison of
races as to superiority, excellent grounds of national
policy for preventing their mingling in large numbers
in the same state. So far as we can judge by experience,
the race antagonism weakens that common spirit,
that moral unity, that willing subordination of the part
to the whole, that are requisite to a healthy national life.
I see no reason why America and Australia should not
avoid the rise of an unnecessary caste problem by
restricting Oriental immigration, or why the Oriental
nations should not, on the same ground, discourage
Occidental colonies. Such measures would not imply
anything derogatory to the other race, and, this being
understood, should give no offense.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>THE NATURE OF VALUATION—HUMAN-NATURE VALUES AND INSTITUTIONAL
VALUES—RELATION BETWEEN THE TWO—VALUES ARE
PHASES OF AN ORGANIC WHOLE—AN OBJECT MAY HAVE MANY
KINDS OF VALUE—VALUATION MOSTLY UNCONSCIOUS—DEFINITE
VALUATION BY INSTITUTIONS</p>

<p class='c010'>The idea of valuation, familiar to all of us in the buyings
and sellings of every-day life, and to students in its
elaboration as the science of political economy, has been
extended beyond this field of tangible exchanges until we
hear discussion of values with reference to almost any
kind of human activity. Painters use the word in connection
with light and color, moralists in questions of
conduct, and so on. Any man or group of men, in any
sphere of life, it appears, may be presumed to act according
to a scale of values.</p>

<p class='c013'>This broad use of the term seems to rest on the feeling
that the judgment of worth is of much the same character,
whether you apply it to a choice between a dozen eggs and
a pound of beef in the market-place, or between shades
of color or lines of conduct: it is a matter of ascertaining
how much the alternatives appeal to you.</p>

<p class='c013'>In short, a system of values is a system of practical
ideas or motives to behavior, and the process of valuation
by which we arrive at these ideas is presumably
that same process of social and mental competition,
selection and organization that we have all along been
considering. Take a simple example: suppose I wish to
drive a nail and have no hammer by me. I look at everything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>within reach with reference to its hammer-value,
that is, with reference to its power to meet the special
situation, and if the monkey-wrench promises more of
this than any other object available, its value rises, it fits
the situation, it is selected, it “works,” and becomes a
more active factor in life. And it is by analogous processes
that men, nations, doctrines, what you will, come
to have various degrees and kinds of value.</p>

<p class='c013'>It would seem that the essential things in the conception
of value are three: an organism, a situation, and an
object. The organism is necessary to give meaning to
the idea; there must be worth <em>to</em> something. It need
not be a person; a group, an institution, a doctrine, any
organized form of life will do; and that it be conscious
of the values that motivate it is not at all essential.
Anything which lives and grows gives rise to a special
system of values having reference to that growth, and
these values are real powers in life, whether persons are
aware of them or not; they are part of the character and
tendency of the organism. The growth of language, for
example, or of forms of art, is guided by valuations of
which the people concerned in it commonly know
nothing. The idea might easily be extended to animal
and plant life, but I shall be content with some of its
human applications.</p>

<p class='c013'>The organism, whatever it may be, is the heart of the
whole matter: we are interested primarily in that because
it is a system of life, <em>our</em> system so long as we attend to
it, and in the values because they function in that life.
The situation is the immediate occasion for action, in
view of which the organism integrates the various values
working within it (as a man does when he “makes up his
mind”) and meets the situation by an act of selection,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>which is a step in its own growth, leading on to new
values and new situations. Valuation is only another
name for tentative organic process.</p>

<p class='c013'>The various classifications of value are based in one
way or another on that of the objects, organisms, or situations
which the general idea of value involves. Thus,
taking the point of view of the object, we speak of grain-values,
stock-values, the values of books, of pictures, of
doctrines, of men. Evidently, however, these are indeterminate
unless we bring in the organism and the situation
to define them. A book has various kinds of value, as
literary and pecuniary, and these again may be different
for different persons or groups.</p>

<p class='c010'>As regards the forms of human life to which values are
to be referred, it seems to me of primary importance to
make a distinction which I will call that between human-nature
values and institutional values.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first are those which may be traced without great
difficulty to phases of universal human nature. The organism
for which they have weight is simply man in those
comparatively permanent aspects which we are accustomed
to speak of as human nature, and to contrast with
the shifting institutions that are built upon it. The objects
possessing these values differ greatly from age to
age, but the tests which are applied to them are fundamentally
much the same, because the organism from which
they spring is much the same. A bright color, a harmonious
sound, have a worth for all men, and we may also
reckon the more universal forms of beauty, those which
men of any age and culture may appreciate through
merely becoming familiar with them, as human-nature
values.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>Values of this kind are as various as human nature
itself and may be differentiated and classified in a hundred
ways. There are some in which particular senses
are the conspicuous factors, as auditory and gustatory
values. Others spring from the social sentiments, like
the values of social self-feeling which underlie conformity,
and those of love, fear, ambition, honor, and loyalty.
Of much the same sort are the more universal religious
and moral values, which, however, are usually entangled
with institutional values of a more transient and special
character. The same may be said of scientific, philosophical
and ethical values, and lasting achievement in
any of these fields depends mainly on the creation of
values which are such for human nature, and not merely
for some transient institutional point of view.</p>

<p class='c013'>The second sort of values are those which must be
ascribed to an institutional system of some sort. Human
nature enters into them but is so transformed in its operation
by the system that we regard the latter as their
source, and are justified in doing so by the fact that
social organisms have a growth and values that cannot,
practically, be explained from the standpoint of general
human nature. The distinction is obvious enough if we
take a clear instance of it, like the distinction between
religious and ecclesiastical values. Such general traits
of religious psychology as are treated in William James’s
Varieties of Religious Experience, give rise to values
that we may call values of human nature; the values
established in the Roman Catholic Church are a very
different matter, though human nature certainly enters
into them. In the same way there are special values for
every sort of institutional development—legal values,
political values, military values, university values, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>so on. All technical values come under this head. Thus
in every art there are not only human-nature values in
the shape of phases of beauty open to men at large, but
technical values, springing from the special history and
methods of the art, which only the expert can appreciate.</p>

<p class='c010'>This distinction, as I have remarked, rests upon the
fact that there are forms of social life having a distinct
organic growth, involving distinct needs and values,
which cannot be understood by direct reference to universal
human nature and the conditions that immediately
influence it. I am aware that it may be difficult to make
in particular cases. It resembles most psychological distinctions
in offering no sharp dividing-line, being simply
a question of the amount and definiteness of social tradition
and structure involved. All human values are more
or less mediated by special social conditions: they might,
perhaps, be arranged in a scale as to the degree in which
they are so mediated; some, like the taste for salt,
hardly at all; others, like the taste for poetry, a great
deal. In dealing with the latter kind we come to a
point on the scale where the social antecedents take on
such definite form and development as to constitute a
distinct organism, which must be studied as such before
we can understand the value situation. In moral values,
for example, there are some, like those of loyalty, kindness,
and courage, which spring quite directly from
human-nature; others, like the obligation to go to church
on Sunday, are evidently institutional.</p>

<p class='c013'>I need hardly add that human and institutional values
often conflict, or that reform consists largely in readjusting
them to each other. Nor need I discuss in detail
the familiar process by which human-nature values,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>seeking realization through a complex social system, are
led to take on organization and an institutional character,
which carries them far away from human nature
and in time calls for a reassertion of the latter, through
the initiative of individuals and small groups. Any
one may see such cycles in the history of the Christian
church, or of any other institution he may prefer to
study.</p>

<p class='c010'>The various human-nature and institutional values
differ among themselves as the phases of the human
mind itself differ: that is, however marked the differences,
the values are after all expressions of a common
organic life. There is no clean-cut separation among
them and at times they merge indistinguishably one
into another. An organic mental-social life has for
one of its phases an organic system of values. For example,
the æsthetic and moral values may seem quite unconnected,
as in the case of a man with a “fair outside”
but a bad character, and yet we feel that there is something
beautiful about perfect goodness and something
good about perfect beauty. It is agreed, I believe, that
the best literature and art are moral, not, perhaps, by
intention, but because the two kinds of value are related
and tend to coincide in their completeness. Alongside of
these we may put truth-value, and say of the three that
they are phases of the highest form of human motive which
often become indistinguishable.</p>

<p class='c013'>The institutional values are also parts of this organic
whole, and merge into the human-nature values, as I
have suggested, so that it may be hard to distinguish
between them. An institution, however, seldom or never
corresponds so closely to a phase of human nature that
the institutional values and the immediately human values
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>on the whole coincide. An idea, in becoming institutional,
adapts itself to the whole traditional structure of
society, taking the past upon its shoulders, and loses much
of the breadth and spontaneity of our more immediate
life. There are no institutions that express adequately
the inner need for beauty, truth, righteousness, and religion
as human nature requires them at a given time: no
church, for example, ever was or can be wholly Christian.</p>

<p class='c013'>Because of this organic character, values vary with
the time, the group, and the special situation. Every
nation or epoch has its more or less peculiar value system,
made up of related parts; any one can see that the
system of the Middle Ages was very different from ours.
Values are a part of the <em>ethos</em>, the <em>mores</em>, or whatever
you choose to call the collective state of mind.<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c014'><sup>[63]</sup></a> Each
individual, also, has a system of values of his own
which is a differentiated member of the system of
the group. And these various group and individual
aspects hang together in such a way that no one aspect
can be explained except by reference to the whole out
of which it grows. You can hardly understand how a
man feels about religion, for example, unless you understand
also how he feels about his industrial position and
about other matters in which he is deeply concerned;
you must, so far as may be, grasp his life as a whole.
And you will hardly do this unless you grasp also the
social medium in which he lives. Any searching study
of any sort of values must be the study of an organic
social life.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is apparent that the same object may have many
kinds of value, perhaps all of those that I have mentioned.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>It is conceivable that man may turn all phases of his life
toward an object and appraise it differently for each
phase. Consider, for instance, an animal like the ox, of
immemorial interest to the human race. It may be regarded
as beautiful or ugly, may arouse the various emotions,
as love, fear, or anger, may give rise to moral and
philosophical questions, may be the object of religious
feeling, as in India, and may have a value for the senses
of sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste. It has also,
especially among the pastoral peoples, notable institutional
values; plays a large part in law, ceremony, and worship,
and, in our own tradition, has an eponymous relation to
pecuniary institutions.<a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c014'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The process that generates value is mental but not
ordinarily conscious; it works by suggestion, influence,
and the competition and survival of ideas; but all this
is constantly going on in and through us without our
knowing it. I may be wholly unaware of the genesis
or even the existence of values which live in my mind and
guide my daily course; indeed this is rather the rule than
the exception. The common phrase, “I have come to
feel differently about it,” expresses well enough the way
in which values usually change. The psychology of the
matter is intricate, involving the influence of repetition,
of subtle associations of ideas, of the prestige of personalities,
giving weight to their example, and the like; but
of all this we commonly know nothing. The idea of
punishment after death, for example, has been fading for
a generation past; its value for conduct has mostly gone;
yet few have been aware of its passing and fewer still
can tell how this has come about. This trait of the growth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>of values is of course well understood in the art of advertising,
which aims, first of all, to give an idea weight in
the subconscious processes, to familiarize it by repetition,
to accredit it by pleasing or imposing associations, to insinuate
it somehow into the current of thought without
giving choice a chance to pass upon it at all.</p>

<p class='c013'>If the simpler phases of valuation, those that relate to
the personal aims of the individual, are usually subconscious,
much more is this true of the larger phases which
relate to the development of complex impersonal wholes.
It is quite true that there are “great social values whose
motivating power directs the activities of nations, of
great industries, of literary and artistic ‘schools,’ of
churches and other social organizations, as well as the
daily lives of every man and woman—impelling them in
paths which no individual man foresaw or purposed.”<a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c014'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The institutions, we may note in this connection,
usually have rather definite and precise methods for the
appraisal of values in accordance with their own organic
needs. In the state, for example, we have elaborate
methods of electing or appointing persons, as well as
legislative, judicial, and scientific authorities for passing
upon ideas. The church has its tests of membership, its
creeds, scriptures, sacraments, penances, hierarchy of
saints and dignitaries, and the like, all of which serve as
standards of value. The army has an analogous system.
On the institutional side of art we have exhibitions with
medals, prize competitions, election to academies and the
verdict of trained critics: in science much the same, with
more emphasis on titles and academic chairs. You will
find something of the same sort in every well-organized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>traditional structure. We have it in the universities,
not only in the official working of the institution, but in
the fraternities, athletic associations, and the like.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is also noteworthy that institutional valuation is
nearly always the function of a special class. This is
obviously the case with the institutions mentioned, and
it is equally true, though perhaps less obviously, with
pecuniary valuation.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXVI<br> <span class='c011'>THE INSTITUTIONAL CHARACTER OF PECUNIARY VALUATION</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>A PHASE OF SOCIAL PROCESS—PECUNIARY VALUES INSTITUTIONAL—INADEQUATE
IDEA OF VALUATION IN ECONOMIC TREATISES—INTERACTION
BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE MARKET—ECONOMIC
VALUES AN OUTCOME OF ECONOMIC HISTORY—THE
FACTOR OF CLASS—INFLUENCE OF UPPER-CLASS IDEALS—POWER
OF THE BUSINESS CLASS OVER VALUES</p>

<p class='c010'>Pecuniary valuation is a phase of the general process
of social thought, having its special methods and significance,
but not peculiar in nature; the pecuniary
estimates people set upon things are determined in a
movement of suggestion and discussion, varying with
the group and the time, like other phases of the public
mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>This is apparent <em>a fortiori</em> if we take what appear to
be the simplest and most essential commodities. The
estimation of wheaten bread as a necessity of life, that
prevails with us, is a matter of opinion and custom;
whether grounded in sound hygiene or not is irrelevant.
Other countries and times have thought differently, and
we know that foods may be regarded as necessary whose
hygienic value is doubtful or negative, like beer in Germany
or coffee with us. Consider in this connection the
prepared foods known as cereals, for which vast sums
are spent by all classes of our people; their vogue and
value is clearly a matter of current, possibly transient,
opinion, largely created by the psychological process of
advertising.</p>

<p class='c013'>I need hardly go further into this. It is plain that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>even among the most necessitous an existing scale of pecuniary
values can be explained only as a product of the
same social forces which create other phases of tradition
and sentiment; and no one will expect anything different
in values prevailing among a richer class. I do not mean,
of course, that these forces work wholly in the air, but
that, whatever physiological or mechanical factors there
may be in demand and supply, these become active only
through the mediation of a psychological process.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is a common saying that values were formerly determined
largely by custom, but that competition has
supplanted the latter; and no doubt this is true in the
sense that the stability of local custom is broken up. In
a somewhat different way, however, custom—the influence
of the past—is as great a factor in the market now
as it ever was. Now as always it is the main source of
the habits of thought that control demand and supply,
and so value. An obvious case is that of funerals. Why
is it that so large a part of the expenditure of the poor
goes for this purpose, so large that a special branch of
insurance is carried on to meet it? Evidently the reasons
are historical, reaching back in fact to prehistoric society.
And although this case appears exceptional, because this
particular convention has lost most of its force among
the educated classes, it is none the less true that we draw
our values from the current of historical influence. What
we are willing to spend money for, as individuals, as
classes, as nations, can be understood only by a study
of historical influences and of their interaction and propagation
at the present time.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have explained the distinction which I think should
be made between human-nature values and institutional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>values, the latter being those which have social antecedents
of so complicated a character that we cannot
understand them except as the outcome of a special institutional
development. It is apparent that the values
of the pecuniary market fall under the latter head. Their
immediate source is a social mechanism, whatever their
indirect relation to human nature may be. You do not
find them wherever man is found, but only where there
is a somewhat developed system of exchange, a commodity
recognized as money, and an active market.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pecuniary values, however, are by no means all upon
the same level as regards the degree in which they are
institutional. All are so in the sense just indicated—that
they require the mechanism of the market to define
and develop them. But if we go back of this we find that
some are based (so far as demand is concerned) upon
rather simple human-nature values, in which the factors
of special tradition and organization play no very great
part. It is remarkable, when you come to think of it,
how few such values there are; but those of meat and
flour, of lumber, fuel, and the simpler kinds of clothing
are relatively of this sort. Some, on the other hand,
are the outgrowth of a complex institutional history
through which it is difficult to trace the threads which
connect them with the permanent needs of human nature.
Such are the values of ornamental or ceremonial dress,
of many of our foods, of our more elaborate houses and
furniture, our amusements and dissipations, our books;
and those connected with our systems of education, our
churches, political institutions, and so on. The same
difference runs through the values set on the services of
different kinds of men. Why society should pay a substantial
price for farmers and carpenters is obvious; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>when you come to lawyers, stock-brokers, promoters, men
of science, advertising men, and the like, not to speak of
the holders of capital, who seem to be paid large sums
for doing nothing at all, it is clear that the explanation
is institutional, not to be reached without a study of the
organic growth and interaction of social forms. And
it seems clear also that values of this latter sort greatly
and increasingly preponderate in our social system.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is a fallacious kind of reasoning often met with
in discussions of value, which consists in taking the
simplest conceivable transactions, generally those of an
imaginary primitive life, noticing the principles upon
which they may have been based, and then assuming
that the same principles suffice for a general explanation
of the complex transactions of our own life. “It is the
same thing now, only more intricate,” is the supposition.
This, of course, overlooks the fact that even granting
that such analyses are otherwise sound, which is very
questionable, the social complexity is for many purposes
the essential thing in the actual value process. It involves
an institutional character, which changes with the
social type, which may be understood only through a
knowledge of institutional organisms, and which can be
reformed only by working upon and through such organisms.
The study of value-making institutions becomes,
then, the principal means of arriving at practical truth.</p>

<p class='c013'>The market (meaning by this the system of pecuniary
transactions regarded as one organic whole) is as much
an institution as the state or the church, which indeed
it somewhat overshadows in modern life. I mean that
it is a vast and complicated social system, rooted in the
past, though grown enormously in recent times, wielding
incalculable prestige, and, though manned by individuals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>like other institutions, by no means to be understood
from a merely individual point of view. It would be as
reasonable to attempt to explain the theology of St.
Thomas Aquinas, or the Institutes of Calvin, by the immediate
working of religious instinct as to explain the
market values of the present time by the immediate
working of natural wants.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is one of many points of view from which we
may see the insufficiency of the usual treatment of the
value-making process in treatises of political economy.
This treatment starts with demand as a <em>datum</em>, assuming
that each individual has made up his mind what he wants
and how much he wants it. There is seldom, I believe,
any serious attempt to go back of this, it being assumed,
apparently, that these wants spring from the inscrutable
depths of the private mind. At any rate it has not been
customary to recognize that they are the expression of an
institutional development. From most of the standard
works the student would get the impression that if institutions
and classes exist at all they have nothing to do
with valuation.</p>

<p class='c013'>The truth, I suppose, is that the idea of institutions,
classes, and the like as organic forms or processes, having
a significance and power not to be grasped from the
standpoint of individuals or of general human nature, is
alien to the philosophy underlying orthodox economics,
and hence difficult of assimilation with orthodox theory.
So far as such ideas are recognized they are, I should
say, rather patched on, than woven into, the original
stuff of the garment.<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c014'><sup>[66]</sup></a> Economists, however, are latterly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>becoming aware of the somewhat obsolete character of
the philosophy involved in the orthodox tradition.<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c014'><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>At any rate the result of the individualistic treatment
of pecuniary value has been to saddle the whole institution—the
market—upon human nature. Commercialism
as we find it had to be explained, and as there was nothing
else available poor human nature had to bear it. The
simple formula, “The people want it, and the law of supply
and demand does the rest,” will explain anything.
But if we allow ourselves to ask why the people want it,
or just who the people are that want it, or why they can
make their wants effective, we discover that we have
everything to learn. The accepted economic treatment
would seem to be equivalent to a renunciation of any attempt
to understand the relation of value to society at
large; or, in other words, of any attempt to understand
value itself, since to understand a thing is to perceive
its more important relations. I do not deny that the
method of analysis in question has its very important
uses, but if it is allowed to be the only method it becomes
the source of the gravest errors.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just what does it mean, from the individual’s standpoint,
when we say that the market, as a historical institution,
is a main factor in values? Not merely that
pre-existing individual estimates are summed up and
equilibrated in accordance with the formulas of economic
science, though this is one phase of the matter, but also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>that the individual estimates themselves are moulded by
the market, at first in a general way and then, in the
process of price-making, drawn toward a somewhat mechanical
uniformity. The individual and the system
act and react upon each other until, in most cases, they
agree, somewhat as in fashion, in religious belief, and the
like. The influence of the market is not secondary either
in time or importance to that of the person; it is a continuous
institution in which the individual lives and
which is ever forming his ideas. The actual transactions
are potent suggestions for new ones, and the actual transactions
are the latest expressions of an institutional development
in which class rule and a confused and one-sided
commercialism have been chief factors. Thus the
institution largely dictates the valuations which it afterward
equilibrates.</p>

<p class='c013'>To neglect this and treat demand and supply as a
summation of original individual estimates involves an
inadequacy of the same nature as there would be in explaining
fashion as due to a summation of individual
ideas about dress. The explanation would be true at a
given instant, in fashion as in the market, but in the
case of the former no one could fail to perceive how
superficial, how delusive, it would be. This is obvious
in the case of fashion because its changes are so rapid
and conspicuous that we are compelled to notice them,
and to see that the individual takes his ideas from the
social current. The slower movement of ideas which
determines our more stable wants is, however, of the
same character, and the superficiality of treating it as
originating in the individual is quite as great, amounting
to no less than ignoring the historical factors in
pecuniary value. The relation of the individual to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>system is not essentially different in this case from what
we may see in any institution. The ordinary man is a
conformer; he lives in the institution and accepts its
established valuations, though not without impressing
some degree of individuality upon them. In this way we
get our ideas and practices regarding religion, marriage,
dress, and so on. So in pecuniary matters one accepts in
a general way the current values but has a certain individuality
in his choices which makes him to some extent
a special factor in the market. There is no absolute
conformity; we do everything a little differently
from any one else; but this does not prevent our being
controlled, in a broad way, by the prevailing institutions.
This is what the usual economic analysis ignores, or perhaps
omits as beyond its proper range.</p>

<p class='c013'>Along with this we have the phenomenon of non-conformity.
Individuals of special natural endowment, or
unusual situation, or both, depart widely from the type,
and initiate new tendencies which, under favorable conditions,
may grow, and modify or destroy the old type.
These new movements are likely to derive more directly
from human nature than the old, and it is commonly
true, though not always, that non-conformity represents
human-nature values in conflict with those that are more
institutional. We can see this process at the present time
in the church, in politics, and in the family. It is taking
place no less in pecuniary relations, and our expenditure
is being humanized as radically, perhaps, as anything
else. Things that seemed indispensable twenty-five years
ago no longer seem worth while, and claims unthought of
then have become irresistible. What changes have come
over the budget of the household, of philanthropy, of
the state and the church, during this period!</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>One might say much on this topic, but it would amount
simply to an exposition, in this field, of the general relation
between institutions and human nature.</p>

<p class='c013'>Without taking into account this life of the individual
in the institution we can never do justice to the general
sway of the market, as a historical organism, over society
at large. It is, as I have suggested, a structure as imposing
as the political state itself, filling the eye with the
spectacle of established and unquestioned power and impressing
its estimates upon every mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have to recognize, then, not merely that pecuniary
value is, in general, a social value which derives from the
social development of the past, but that it is the outcome,
more particularly, of a special phase of that development,
namely, the comparatively recent growth of industry and
business, including also the growth of consumption.
This is the special institution from which, for better or
worse, the pecuniary values of to-day draw their character,
very much as ecclesiastical values draw theirs from
the history of the church. The phenomena of any institution
are moulded in part by the general conditions of
the time, but they are moulded especially by their particular
institutional antecedents, which may be somewhat
incongruous with the more general conditions. If you
attend a service of the Established Church you become
aware of points of view which may seem to you, as a
man of to-day, absurd and incomprehensible, except as
you know something of their history. The same may
very well be true in the pecuniary world, though we may
not notice it because we are more used to it, because we
are ourselves members of this church.</p>

<p class='c013'>And the method of criticism, in the market as in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>church, is to take as large a view of the institution as
possible, discover in what respects it is failing to function
adequately in the general life, and strive to bring
about such changes as seem to be required.</p>

<p class='c013'>It seems probable that the more we consider, in the
light of an organic view of society, the practice of discussing
values apart from their institutional antecedents,
the more sterile, except for somewhat narrowly technical
purposes, this practice will appear. Certainly it should
have but a secondary place in inquiries which seek to
throw light upon ethics or social policy. It is, for example,
but a frail basis for a theory of distribution. The
latter I take to be essentially a historical and institutional
phenomenon, economic technique being for the most part
only a mechanism through which social organization expresses
itself. I do not question the technical value of
the current treatises on distribution which more or less
cut it off from its roots in the social whole, but perhaps
the time is coming for a treatment which takes technical
economics for granted and elucidates the larger actualities
of the question.</p>

<p class='c010'>The principle that any social institution, and consequently
any system of valuation, must be administered
by a class, which will largely control its operation, is
rather an obvious one. It was long overlooked, however,
in political theory, at least in the theory of democracy,
and is still overlooked, perhaps, in economic theory.
At any rate it is a fact that pecuniary valuation is by no
means the work of the whole people acting homogeneously,
but is subject, very much like the analogous function
in politics, to concentration in a class.</p>

<p class='c013'>Class control is exercised mainly in two ways: through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>control or guidance of purchasing power, and so of the
demand side of the market, and through the actual administration
of the business system, which gives the class
in possession command of the large personal (pecuniary)
values incident to this function, and the opportunity to
increase these by the use, direct and indirect, of their
commanding position.<a id='r68'></a><a href='#f68' class='c014'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The process of definite pecuniary valuation, the price-making
function, is based upon “effective demand” or
the offer of money for goods; perhaps we ought to say
for consumers’ goods, as the value of producers’ goods
may be regarded as secondary.<a id='r69'></a><a href='#f69' class='c014'><sup>[69]</sup></a> It is, therefore, the
immediate work of those who have money to spend.
Just how far spending is concentrated in a class I cannot
pretend to say, but current estimates indicate that about
one-fifth of the families in the United States absorb half
the total income. No doubt, however, the proportion of
saving in this fifth is somewhat greater, and that of
spending somewhat less, than in the rest of the population.<a id='r70'></a><a href='#f70' class='c014'><sup>[70]</sup></a>
In this respect pecuniary value is, on the face of
it, much more the work of a restricted class than political
value, in determining which all voters are nominally
equal. In either case, however, it would be most erroneous
to suppose that value-making power can be measured
in any such numerical way. There is always a psychological
process of suggestion and discussion which works
underneath the market transactions.</p>

<p class='c013'>By virtue of this the power of the richer classes over
values is far greater than that indicated by their relative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>expenditure. As people of leisure and presumptive refinement,
they have prestige in forming those conventions
by which expenditure is ruled. We see how cooks and
shop-girls dress in imitation of society women, and how
clerks mortgage their houses to buy automobiles. It is
in fact notorious that the expenditure of the poor follows
the fashions of the rich, unless in matters of the most
direct and urgent necessity, and in no small degree even
in these.</p>

<p class='c010'>If what has just been said is sound it would be necessary,
in order to understand contemporary values, to
investigate, historically and psychologically, the ideals,
such as they are, now prevalent in the richer classes.<a id='r71'></a><a href='#f71' class='c014'><sup>[71]</sup></a>
It might be found, perhaps, that these are largely of two
sorts: ideals proper to commercialism—especially ideals
of pecuniary power and of display as an evidence of it—and
caste ideals taken over by the commercial aristocracy
from an older order of society. Commercialism tends
to fix attention rather on the acquisition than the use of
wealth, and for ideals regarding the latter the successful
class has fallen back upon the traditions, so well-knit and
so attractive to the imagination, of a former hereditary
aristocracy. We very inadequately realize, I imagine,
how much our modes of thought, and hence our valuations,
are dominated by English social ideals of the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. We get these not
only through the social prestige, continuous to our own
day, of the English upper classes, but through history,
literature, and art. Speaking roughly, the best European
literature, and especially the best English literature, was
produced under the dominance of an aristocratic class and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>is permeated with its ideals. Thus culture, even now,
means in no small degree the absorption of these ideals.</p>

<p class='c013'>They are, of course, in many respects high ideals, embracing
conceptions of personal character, culture and
conduct which it would be a calamity to lose; and
yet these are interwoven with the postulate of an upper
class, enjoying of right an enormous preponderance of
wealth and power, and living in an affluence suitable to
its appointed station. Thus it happens that as a man
acquires wealth he feels that it is becoming that his family
should assert its right of membership in the upper class
by a style of living that shall proclaim his opulence. He
also feels, if he has in any degree assimilated the finer
part of the tradition, that a corresponding advance in
culture would be becoming to him, but this is a thing by
no means so readily purchased as material state; the
general conditions are not favorable to it, and his efforts,
if he makes any, are apt to be somewhat abortive.</p>

<p class='c013'>Along with the preceding we have also a hopeful admixture
of ideals which reflect the dawn of a truly democratic
régime of life—ideals of the individual as existing
for the whole, of power as justified only by public service,
compunctions regarding the inequalities of wealth and
opportunity, a lowly spirit in high places.</p>

<p class='c013'>This sort of inquiry into the psychology of the upper
class as a social organism—however unimportant these
suggestions may be—appears to be indispensable if we
are to form even an intelligent guess as to where we
stand in the matter of valuation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Coming now to the control over values incident to the
administration of the business system, we note that the
class in power, in spite of constant changes in its membership,
is for many purposes a real historical organism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>acting collectively for its own aggrandizement. This
collective action is for the most part unconscious, and
comes about as the resultant of the striving of many individuals
and small groups in the same general direction.
We are all, especially in pecuniary matters, ready to
join forces with those whose interest is parallel to our
own: bankers unite to promote the banking interest,
manufacturers form associations, and so on. The whole
business world is a network of associations, formal and
informal, which aim to further the pecuniary interest of
the members. And while these groups, or members of the
same group, are often in competition with one another,
this does not prevent a general parallelism of effort as
regards matters which concern the interest of the business
class as a whole. The larger the group the less conscious,
as a rule, is its co-operation, but it is not necessarily less
effective and it can hardly be denied that the capitalist-manager
class, or whatever we may call the class ascendant
in business, acts powerfully as a body in maintaining and
increasing its advantages over other classes. Nothing
else can result from the desire of each to get and keep all
he can, and to exchange aid with others similarly inclined.<a id='r72'></a><a href='#f72' class='c014'><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>When I say that the class is, for this purpose, a historical
organism, I mean that its power, prestige, and methods
come down from the past in a continuous development
like other forms of social life. This would be the case
even were individual membership in it quite free to every
one in proportion to his ability, for an open class, as we
can see, for instance, in the case of a priesthood, may yet
be full of a spirit and power derived from the past.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>In fact, however, membership in the upper economic
class is by no means open to all in proportion to natural
ability, and the command it enjoys of lucrative opportunities
contributes greatly to its ascendancy. It controls
the actual administration of the market much as
the political party in power used to control the offices,
with the influence and patronage pertaining to them—only
the ascendancy in the economic world, based largely
on inherited wealth and connections, is greater and more
secure. The immediate effect of this is to enhance greatly
the market value of the persons having access to the opportunities:
they are enabled by their advantageous
position to draw from the common store salaries, fees,
and profits not at all explicable by natural ability alone.
This effect is multiplied by the fact that limitation of the
number of competitors gives an additional scarcity value
to the services of the competent, which may raise their
price almost incredibly. Thus it is well known that during
the period of rapid consolidation of the great industries
enormous fees, amounting in some cases to millions,
were paid to those who effected the consolidations. It
may be that their services were worth the price; but in
so far as this is the fact it can be explained only as an
exorbitant scarcity value due to limitation of opportunity.
No one will contend, I suppose, that the native
ability required was of so transcendent a character as
to get such a reward under open conditions. Evidently
of the thousands who might have been competent to the
service only a few were on hand with such training and
connections as to make them actual competitors. And
the same principle is quite generally required to explain
the relatively large incomes of the class in power, including
those of the more lucrative professions. They represent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>the value of good natural ability multiplied by
opportunity factors.<a id='r73'></a><a href='#f73' class='c014'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The fact usually urged in this connection, that these
lucrative opportunities often fall to those who were not
born in the upper class but have made their way into it
by their own energy, is not very much to the point. It
is not contended that our upper class is a closed caste,
nor does it have to be in order to act as a whole, or to
exercise a dominating and somewhat monopolistic influence
over values. Though ill defined, not undemocratic
in sentiment, and partly free from the hereditary
character of European upper classes, it is yet a true historical
successor of the latter, and dominates the weaker
classes in much the same way as stronger classes have
always done. Power is concentrated about the functions
of the dominant institutions, and the powerful
class use it, consciously or otherwise, for their individual
and class advantage. Surely one has only to open his
eyes to see this. I doubt whether there is a city, village,
or township in the country where there is not a group of
men who constitute an upper class in this sense. There
is, it seems to me, a growing feeling that class, which the
prevalent economics has relegated to oblivion under some
such category as “imperfect freedom of competition,” is
in fact at the very heart of our problem.</p>

<p class='c013'>It appears, then, that pecuniary valuation is a social
institution no less than the state or the church, and that
its development must be studied not only on the impersonal
side but also in the traditions and organization of
the class that chiefly administers it.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXVII<br> <span class='c011'>THE SPHERE OF PECUNIARY VALUATION</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>THE SPECIAL FUNCTION OF MONEY VALUATION—PECUNIARY VALUES
NOT NECESSARILY OF A LOWER SORT—THEY ARE FORMED, HOWEVER,
BY A SPECIAL INSTITUTION—AND PERPETUATE HISTORIC
WRONG—THEY HAVE ONLY A LIMITED CONTROL OF SOCIAL LIFE—MONEY
REWARD VERSUS SELF-EXPRESSION—WE NEED TO
EXTEND THE SPHERE OF MONEY VALUES</p>

<p class='c010'>It seems that the distinctive function of money valuation
is to generalize or assimilate values through a common
measure. In this way it gives them reach and flexibility,
so that many sorts of value are enabled to work
freely together throughout the social system, instead of
being confined to a small province. And since values
represent the powers of society, the result is that these
powers are organized in a large way and enabled to co-operate
in a vital whole. Any <em>market</em> value that I, for
instance, may control ceases to be merely local in its application
and becomes a generalized force that I can apply
anywhere. If I can earn a thousand dollars teaching
bacteriology, I can take the money and go to Europe,
exchanging my recondite knowledge for the services,
say, of guides in the Alps, who never heard of bacteriology.
Other values are similarly generalized and the result is
a mobility that enables many sorts of value, reduced to a
common measure, to be applied anywhere and anyhow
that the holder may think desirable.</p>

<p class='c013'>We have, then, to do with a value institution or process,
far transcending in reach any special sort of value, and
participating in the most diverse phases of our life. Its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>function resembles that of language, and its ideal may be
said to be to do for value what language does for thought—furnish
a universal medium of communicative growth.
And just as language and the social organization based
upon it are extended in their scope by the modern devices
of cheap printing, mails, telegraphy, telephones, and the
like, so the function of pecuniary valuation is extended
by uniform money and by devices for credit and transfer,
until the natural obstacles of distance, lack of knowledge,
and lack of homogeneity are largely overcome.</p>

<p class='c013'>This mobilization of values through the pecuniary
measure tends to make the latter an expression of the
total life of society, so far as the values that stand for
this life have actually become mobilized or translated
into pecuniary terms. Although this translation is in
fact only partial and, as I have tried to show, institutional,
still the wide scope of pecuniary value, along with its
precision, gives it a certain title to its popular acceptance
as value in a sense that no other kind of value can
claim.</p>

<p class='c013'>This also gives it that place as a regulator of social
activity which economists have always claimed for it.
Pecuniary value provides a motive to serve the pecuniary
organism, a motive that penetrates everywhere, acts
automatically, and adjusts itself delicately to the conditions
of demand and supply. If more oranges are wanted
in New York, a higher price is offered for them in California
and Sicily; if more dentists are needed, the rewards
of the profession increase and young men are attracted
into it. Thus there is everywhere an inducement to supply
those goods and services which the buying power in
society thinks it wants, and this inducement largely guides
production. At each point of deficient supply a sort of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>suction is set up to draw available persons and materials
to that point and set them to work.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus our life, in one of its main aspects, is organized
through this central value institution or market, very
much as in other aspects it is organized through language,
the state, the church, or the family.</p>

<p class='c010'>It will be well to consider here the view that the sphere
of pecuniary value, however wide, is yet distinctly circumscribed
and confined to a special and, on the whole,
inferior province of life. According to this view only the
coarser and more material values can be measured in
money, while the finer sorts, as of beauty, friendship,
righteousness, and so on, are in their nature private and
untranslatable, and so out of the reach of any generalizing
process.</p>

<p class='c013'>It seems doubtful whether we can admit that there is
any such clear circumscription of the pecuniary field.
All values are interrelated, and it may reasonably be
held that none can stand apart and be wholly incommensurable
with the others. The idea of a common
measure which, for certain purposes at least, may be applied
to <em>all</em> values is by no means absurd. The argument
that such a measure is possible may be stated somewhat
as follows.</p>

<p class='c013'>Since the function of values is to guide conduct, they
are in their nature comparable. Conduct is a matter of
the total or synthetic behavior of a living whole in view
of a situation: it implies the integration of all the motives
bearing on the situation. Accordingly when a
crisis in conduct arises the values relating to it, no matter
how incommensurable they may seem, are in some way
brought to a common measure, weighed against one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>another, in order to determine which way the scale inclines.
This commensuration is psychical, not numerical,
and we are far from understanding its exact nature,
but unless each pertinent kind of value has a part in it
of some sort it would seem that the mind is not acting as
a vital whole. If there were absolute values that cannot
be impaired or in any way influenced by the opposing
action of other values, they must apparently exist in separate
compartments and not in organic relation to the
rest of the mind. It does not follow that what we regard
as a high motive, such as the sense of honor, must necessarily
be overcome by a sufficient accumulation of lower
motives, such as sensuous desires, but we may be prepared
to find that if the two are opposed the latter will, in one
way or another, modify the conduct required by the former,
and this I believe is usually the fact. Thus suppose a
lower value, in the shape of temptation, is warring against
a higher in the shape of an ideal. Even if we concede
nothing to the former, even if we react far away from it,
none the less it has entered into our life and helped to
mould it—as sensuality, for example, helps to mould the
ascetic.</p>

<p class='c013'>And this weighing of one kind of value against another
will take place largely in terms of money, which exists
for the very purpose of facilitating such transactions.
Thus honor is one of those values which many would
place outside the pecuniary sphere, and yet honor may
call for the saving of money to pay a debt, while sensuality
would spend it for a hearty dinner. In this case,
then, we buy our honor with money, or we sell it, through
money, for something lower. In much the same way are
the larger choices of society, as, for example, between
power devoted to education and power devoted to warships,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>expressed in pecuniary terms. In general we do,
in fact, individually and collectively, weigh such things
as friendship, righteousness, and beauty against other
matters, and in terms of money. Beauty is on the
market, however undervalued, in the form, for example,
of music, art, literature, flowers, and dwelling-sites. A
friendly personality has a market value in salesmen, doctors,
writers, and teachers; indeed in all occupations
where ability to influence persons is important—and
there are few in which it is not. I notice that if there is
anything attractive about a man he soon learns to collect
pay for it. And not less is it true that the need for
righteousness finds expression in a willingness to pay a
(reasonable) price for it in the market-place. Convincing
preachers and competent social workers command
salaries, and great sums go to beneficent institutions.</p>

<p class='c013'>The truth is that the values we think of as absolute
are only, if I may use the expression, relatively absolute.
That is, they so far transcend the values of every-day
traffic that we think of them as belonging to a wholly
different order, but experience shows that they do not.
Life itself is not an absolute value, since we constantly
see it sacrificed to other ends; chastity is sold daily by
people not radically different in nature from the rest of
us, and as for honor it would be hard to imagine a kind
which might not, in conceivable situations, be renounced
for some other and perhaps higher aim. The idea of the
baseness of weighing the higher sort of values in the same
scale with money rests on the assumption that the money
is to be used to purchase values of a lower sort; but if it
is the indispensable means to still higher values we shall
justify the transaction. Such exchanges are constantly
taking place: only those who are protected by pecuniary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>affluence can imagine otherwise. The health of mothers
is sacrificed for money to support their children, and the
social opportunities of sisters given up to send brothers
to college. In the well-to-do classes, at least, the life of
possible children is often renounced on grounds of expense.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are, no doubt, individuals who have set their
hearts on particular things for which they will sacrifice
without consideration almost anything else. These may
be high things, like love, justice, and honor; they are
often ignoble things, like avarice or selfish ambition.
And, in a similar way, nations or institutions sometimes
cherish values which are almost absolute, like those of
national independence, or the authority of the Pope.
But in general we may say that if <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> be among
our most cherished objects, then situations may occur
where, through the medium of money, some sacrifice of
<em>X</em> will be made for the sake of <em>Y</em>.</p>

<p class='c013'>I conclude, then, that it is impossible to mark off
sharply the pecuniary sphere from that of other kinds of
value. It is always possible that the highest as well as
the lowest things may be brought within its scope.</p>

<p class='c010'>And yet we all feel that the pecuniary sphere has limitations.
The character of these may be understood, I
think, by recurring to the idea that the market is a special
institution in much the same sense that the church is
or the state. It has a somewhat distinct system of its
own in society at large much as it has in the mind of each
individual. Our buyings and sellings and savings, our
pecuniary schemes and standards, make in some degree
a special tract of thought that often seems unconnected
with other tracts. Yet we constantly have to bring the
ideas of this tract into relation with those outside it;
and likewise in society the pecuniary institution is in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>constant interaction with other institutions, this interaction
frequently taking the form of a translation of values.
In general the social process is an organic whole somewhat
clearly differentiated into special systems, of which
the pecuniary is one.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are many histories that fall mainly within this
system and must be studied chiefly from the pecuniary
point of view, not forgetting, however, that no social
history is really understood until it is seen in its place
as a phase of the general process. The histories I mean are
those that have always been regarded as the peculiar
business of the economist: the course of wheat from the
grain-field to the breakfast-table, or of iron from the mine
to the watch-spring, the growth of the social organizations
created for purposes of manufacture, trade, banking,
finance, and so on. There are other histories, like those
of books, educational institutions, religious faith, scientific
research, and the like, which must be understood
chiefly from other points of view, although they are
never outside the reach of pecuniary relations.</p>

<p class='c013'>To say, then, that almost any kind of value may at
times be measured in pecuniary terms is by no means
to say that the latter are a universal and adequate expression
of human nature and of society. On the contrary,
pecuniary value is, in the main, a specialized type
of value, generated within a specialized channel of the
social process, and having decided limitations corresponding
to this fact. I shall try to indicate a little more closely
what some of these limitations are.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let us notice, in the first place, that the pecuniary values
of to-day derive from the whole past of the pecuniary
system, so that all the wrongs that may have worked
themselves into that system are implicit in them. If a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>materialized ruling class is in the saddle, this fact will be
expressed in the large incomes of this class and their
control not only of the mechanism of the market but,
through prestige, of the demand which underlies its values.
If drink, child labor, prostitution, and corrupt politics
are part of the institution, they will be demanded upon
the market as urgently as anything else. Evidently it
would be fatuous to assume that the market process expresses
the <em>good</em> of society. The demand on which it is
based is a turbid current coming down from the past and
bearing with it, for better or worse, the outcome of history.
All the evils of commercialism are present in it,
and are transmitted through demand to production and
distribution. To accept this stream as pure and to reform
only the mechanism of distribution would be as if
a city drawing its drinking-water from a polluted river
should expect to escape typhoid by using clean pipes.
We have reason, both in theory and in observation, to
expect that our pecuniary tradition, and the values which
express it, will need reform quite as much as anything
else.</p>

<p class='c013'>Indeed we cannot expect, do what we may to reform
it, that the market can ever become an adequate expression
of ideal values. It is an institution, and institutional
values, in their nature, are conservative, representing
the achieved and established powers of society rather
than those which are young and look to the future. The
slow crystallization of historical tendencies in institutions
is likely at the best to lag behind our ideals and cannot
be expected to set the pace of progress.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suppose, however, we assume for the time being that
demand does represent the good of society, and inquire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>next how far the market process may be trusted to realize
this good through the pecuniary motive.</p>

<p class='c013'>It seems clear that this motive can serve as an effective
guide only in the case of deliberate production, for the
sake of gain, and with ownership in the product. The
production must be deliberate in order that <em>any</em> rational
motive may control it, and the pecuniary motive will
not control it unless it is for the sake of gain and protected
by ownership. These limitations exclude such
vast provinces of life that we may well wonder at the
extent of our trust in the market process.</p>

<p class='c013'>They shut out the whole matter of the production and
development of men, of human and social life; that is,
they indicate that however important the pecuniary process
may be in this field it can never be trusted to control
it, not even the economic side of it. This is a sphere in
which the market must be dominated by other kinds of
organization.</p>

<p class='c013'>If we take the two underlying factors, heredity and environment,
as these mould the life of men, we see that
we cannot look to the market to regulate the hereditary
factor as regards either the total number of children to
be born, or the stocks from which they are to be drawn.
I know that there are men who still imagine that “natural
selection,” working through economic competition, operates
effectively in this field, but I doubt whether any one
knows facts upon which such a view can reasonably be
based. In what regards population and eugenics it is
more and more apparent that rational control and selection,
working largely outside the market process, are
indispensable.</p>

<p class='c013'>The same may be said of the whole action of environment
in forming persons after birth, including the family,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>the community, the school, the state, the church, and
the unorganized working of suggestion and example.
None of these formative agencies is of a nature to be
guided adequately by pecuniary demand. The latter,
even if its requirements be high, offers no guarantee that
men will be produced in accordance with these requirements,
since it does not control the course of their development.</p>

<p class='c013'>Let us observe, however, that even in this field the
market may afford essential guidance to other agencies
of control. If, for example, certain kinds of work do not
yield a living wage, this may be because the supply of this
kind of work is in excess, and the state or some other organization
may proceed on this hint to adjust supply
to demand by vocational training and guidance. Or the
method of reform may be to put restrictions upon demand,
as in the case of the minimum wage. Although the
market process is inadequate alone, it will usually have
some share in any plan of betterment.</p>

<p class='c013'>Personal and social development must, in general, be
sought through rational organization having a far wider
scope than the market, though co-operating with that in
every helpful way, and including, perhaps, radical reforms
in the pecuniary system itself. It would be hard
to formulate a principle more fallacious and harmful
than the doctrine that the latter is an adequate regulator
of human life, or that its own processes are superior to
regulation. We are beginning to see that the prevalence
of such ideas has given us over to an unhuman commercialism.</p>

<p class='c013'>What I have been saying of persons and personal development
applies also to natural resources and public
improvements, to arts, sciences, and the finer human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>values in general. All these have a pecuniary aspect,
of more or less importance, but a money demand alone
cannot beget or control them. Love, beauty, and righteousness
may come on the market under certain conditions,
but they are not, in the full sense, market commodities.
Our faith in money is exemplified in these days
by the offer of money prizes for poetry, invention, the
promotion of peace, and for heroic deeds. I would not
deprecate such offers, whose aim is excellent and sometimes
attains the mark. They are creditable to their
authors and diffuse a good spirit even though the method
is too naïve to be very effectual. If money is greatly
to increase products of this kind it must be applied, fundamentally
and with all possible wisdom, to the conditions
that mould character.</p>

<p class='c013'>These higher goods do not really come within the economic
sphere. They touch it only incidentally, their
genesis and interaction belonging mainly to a different
kind of process, one in which ownership and material
exchange play a secondary part. The distinctively economic
commodities and values are those whose whole
course of production is one in which the factors are subject
to legal ownership and controlled by a money-seeking
intelligence, so that the process is essentially pecuniary.
Thus we may say that ordinary typewriting is economic,
because it is a simple, standard service which is supplied
in any quantity according to demand. The work of a
newspaper reporter is not quite so clearly economic, because
not so definitely standardized and affording more
room for intangible merits which pay cannot insure.
And when we come to magazine literature of the better
sort we are in a field where the process is for the most
part non-pecuniary, depending, that is, on an interplay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>of minds outside the market, the latter coming in only
to set its very questionable appraisal on the product.
As to literature in general, art, science, and religion, no
one at all conversant with the history of these things
will claim that important work in them has any close relation
to pecuniary inducement. The question whether
the great man was rich and honored, like Rubens, or
worked in poverty and neglect, like Rembrandt in his
later years, is of only incidental interest in tracing the
history of such achievement. The ideals and disciplines
which give birth to it are generated in non-pecuniary
tracts of thought and intercourse, and unless genius
actually starves, as it sometimes does, it fulfils its aim
without much regard to pay. I need hardly add that
good judges have always held that a moderate poverty
was a condition favorable to intellectual and spiritual
achievement.</p>

<p class='c013'>I would assign a very large and growing sphere to pecuniary
valuation, but we cannot be too clear in affirming
that even at its best and largest it can never be an adequate
basis for general social organization. It is an institution,
like another, having important functions but
requiring, like all institutions, to be brought under rational
control by the aid of a comprehensive sociology,
ethics, and politics. It has no charter of autonomy, no
right to exemption from social control.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus even if market values were the best possible of
their kind, we could not commit the social system to their
charge, and still less can we do so when the value institution,
owing to rapid and one-sided growth, is in a somewhat
confused and demoralized condition. Bearing with
it not only the general inheritance of human imperfection
but also the special sins of a narrow and somewhat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>inhuman commercialism, it by no means reflects life in
that broad way in which a market, with all its limitations,
might reflect it. The higher values remain for the most
part untranslated, even though translatable, and the
material and technical aspects of the process have acquired
an undue ascendancy. In general this institution,
like others that might be named, is in such a condition
that its estimates are no trustworthy expression of the
public mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having in mind these general limitations upon the
sphere of pecuniary value, let us consider it more particularly
as a motive to stimulate and guide the work of
the individual. For this purpose we may distinguish
it broadly from the need of self-expression, using the latter
comprehensively to include all other influences that urge
one to productive work. Among these would be emulation
and ambition, the need of activity for its own sake,
the love of workmanship and creation, the impulse to
assert one’s individuality, and the desire to serve the
social whole. Such motives enter intimately into one’s
self-consciousness and may, for our present purpose, be
included under the need of self-expression.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is true that the pecuniary motive may also be, indirectly,
a motive of self-expression; that is, for example,
a girl may work hard for ten dollars with which to buy
a pretty hat. It makes a great difference, however,
whether or not the work is <em>directly</em> self-expressive, whether
the worker feels that what he does is joyous and rewarding
in itself, so that it would be worth doing whether he
were paid for it or not. The artist, the poet, the skilled
craftsman in wood and iron, the born teacher or lawyer,
all have this feeling, and it is desirable that it should become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>as common as possible. I admit that the line is
not a sharp one, but on the whole the pecuniary motive
may be said to be an extrinsic one, as compared with the
more intrinsic character of those others which I have
called motives of self-expression.</p>

<p class='c013'>When I say that self-expression is a regulator of productive
activity I mean that, like the pecuniary motive,
though in a different way, it is the expression of an organic
whole, and not necessarily a less authoritative expression.
What a man feels to be self-expressive springs
in part from the instincts of human nature and in part
from the form given to those instincts by the social life
in which his mind develops. Both of these influences
spring from the organic life of the human race. The
man of genius who opens new ways in poetry and art,
the social reformer who spends his life in conflict with inhuman
conditions, the individual anywhere or of any sort
who tries to realize the needs of his higher being, represents
the common life of man in a way that may have a
stronger claim than the requirements of pecuniary demand.
As a motive it is quite as universal as the latter, and there
is no one of us who has not the capacity to feel it.</p>

<p class='c013'>As regards the individual himself, self-expression is
simply the deepest need of his nature. It is required for
self-respect and integrity of character, and there can be
no question more fundamental than that of so ordering
life that the mass of men may have a chance to find self-expression
in their principal activity.</p>

<p class='c013'>These two motives are related much as are our old
friends conformity and individuality; we have to do in
fact with a phase of the same antithesis. Pecuniary
valuation, like conformity, furnishes a somewhat mechanical
and external rule: it represents the social organization
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>in its more explicit and established phases,
and especially, of course, the pecuniary institution,
which has a life somewhat distinct from that of other
phases of the establishment. It is based on those powers
in society which are readily translated into pecuniary
terms, on wealth, position, established industrial and
business methods, and so on. Self-expression springs
from the deeper and more obscure currents of life, from
subconscious, unmechanized forces which are potent without
our understanding why. It represents humanity
more immediately and its values are, or may be, more
vital and significant than those of the market; we may
look to them for art, for science, for religion, for moral
improvement, for all the fresher impulses to social progress.
The onward things of life usually come from men
whose imperious self-expression disregards the pecuniary
market. In humbler tasks self-expression is required to
give the individual an immediate and lively interest in
his work; it is the motive of art and joy, the spring of all
vital achievement.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is quite possible that these motives should work
harmoniously together; indeed they do so in no small
proportion of cases. A man who works because he wants
money comes, under favorable conditions, to take pleasure
and pride in what he does. Or he takes up a certain
sort of work because he likes it, and finds that his zeal
helps him to pecuniary success. I suppose that there
are few of us with whom the desire of self-expression
would alone be sufficient to incite regular production.
Most of us need a spur to do even that which we enjoy
doing, or at any rate to do it systematically. We are
compelled to do something and many of us are fortunate
enough to find something that is self-expressive.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>The market, it would seem, should put a gentle pressure
upon men to produce in certain directions, spurring the
lazy and turning the undecided into available lines of
work. Those who have a clear inner call should resist
this pressure, as they always have done, and always must
if we are to have progress. This conflict between the
pecuniary system and the bias of the individual, though
in some sort inevitable, should not be harsh or destructive.
The system should be as tolerant and hospitable as its
institutional nature permits. Values, like public opinion
to which they are so closely related, should be constantly
awakened, enlightened, enlarged, and made to
embrace new sorts of personal merit. There is nothing
of more public value than the higher sort of self-expression,
and this should be elicited and rewarded in every practicable
way. It is possible to have institutions which
are not only tolerant but which, in a measure, anticipate
and welcome useful kinds of non-conformity.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pecuniary valuation, represented by the offer of wages,
will never produce good work nor a contented people
until it is allied with such conditions that a man feels
that his task is in some sense <em>his</em>, and can put himself
heartily into it. This means some sort of industrial
democracy—control of working conditions by the state
or by unions, co-operation, socialism—something that
shall give the individual a human share in the industrial
whole of which he is a member.</p>

<p class='c013'>Closely related to this is the sense of worthy service.
No man can feel that his work is self-expressive unless he
believes that it is good work and can see that it serves
mankind. If the product is trivial or base he can hardly
respect himself, and the demand for such things, as Ruskin
used to say, is a demand for slavery. Or if the employer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>for whom a man works and who is the immediate
beneficiary of his labors is believed to be self-seeking beyond
what is held legitimate, and not working honorably
for the general good, the effect will be much the same.
The worst sufferers from such employers are the men who
work for them, whether their wages be high or low.</p>

<p class='c013'>As regards the general relation in our time between
market value and self-expression, the fact seems to be
something as follows: Our industrial system has undergone
an enormous expansion and an almost total change
of character. In the course of this, human nature has
been dragged along, as it were, by the hair of the head.
It has been led or driven into kinds of work and conditions
of work that are repugnant to it, especially repugnant in
view of the growth of intelligence and of democracy in
other spheres of life. The agent in this has been the
pecuniary motive backed by the absence of alternatives.
This pecuniary motive has reflected a system of values
determined under the ascendancy, direct and indirect,
of the commercial class naturally dominant in a time of
this kind. I will not say that as a result of this state of
things the condition of the hand-workers is worse than
in a former epoch; in some respects it seems worse, in
many it is clearly better; but certainly it is far from what
it should be in view of the enormous growth of human
resources.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the economic philosophy which has prevailed along
with this expansion, the pecuniary motive has been accepted
as the legitimate principle of industrial organization
to the neglect of self-expression. The human self,
however, is not to be treated thus with impunity; it is
asserting itself in a somewhat general discontent and in
many specific forms of organized endeavor. The commercialism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>that accepts as satisfactory present values
and the method of establishing them is clearly on the
decline and we have begun to work for a more self-expressive
order.</p>

<p class='c010'>Notwithstanding the insufficiencies of pecuniary valuation,
the character of modern life seems to call for an
extension of its scope: it would appear to be true, in a
certain sense, that the principle that everything has its
price should be rather enlarged than restricted. The
ever-vaster and more interdependent system in which
we live requires for its organization a corresponding value
mechanism, just as it requires a mechanism of transportation
and communication. And this means not
only that the value medium should be uniform, adaptable,
and stable, but also that the widest possible range of
values should be convertible into it. The wider the
range the more fully does the market come to express and
energize the aims of society. It is a potent agent, and
the more good work we can get it to take hold of the
better. Its limitations, then, by no means justify us in
assuming that it has nothing to do with ideals or morals.
On the contrary, the method of progress in every sphere
is to transfuse the higher values into the working institutions
and keep the latter on the rise. Just as the law
exists to formulate and enforce certain phases of righteousness,
and is continually undergoing criticism and
revision based on moral judgments, so ought every institution,
and especially the pecuniary system, to have constant
renewal from above. It should be ever in process
of moral regeneration, and the method that separates it
from the ethical sphere, while justifiable perhaps for certain
technical inquiries, becomes harmful when given a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>wider scope. As regards responsibility to moral requirements
there is no fundamental difference between pecuniary
valuation and the state, the church, education, or
any other institution. We cannot expect to make our
money values ideal, any more than our laws, our sermons,
or our academic lectures, but we can make them better,
and this is done by bringing higher values upon the
market.</p>

<p class='c013'>To put it otherwise, the fact that pecuniary values
fail to express the higher life of society creates a moral
problem which may be met in either of two ways. One
is to depreciate money valuation altogether and attempt
to destroy its prestige. The other is to concede to it a
very large place in life, even larger, perhaps, than it
occupies at present, and to endeavor to regenerate it
by the translation into it of the higher values. The
former way is analogous with that somewhat obsolete
form of religion which gave up this world to the devil
and centred all effort on keeping out of it, in preparation
for a wholly different world to be gained after death.
The world and the flesh, which could not really be escaped,
were left to a neglected and riotous growth.</p>

<p class='c013'>In like manner, perceiving that pecuniary values give
in many respects a debasing reflection of life, we are
tempted to rule them out of the ethical field and consign
them to an inferior province. The price of a thing, we
say, is a material matter which has nothing to do with
its higher values, and never can have. This, however,
is bad philosophy, in economics as in religion. The pecuniary
values are members of the same general system
as the moral and æsthetic values, and it is part of their
function to put the latter upon the market. To separate
them is to cripple both, and to cripple life itself by cutting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>off the healthy interchange among its members. Our
line of progress lies, in part at least, not over commercialism
but through it; the dollar is to be reformed
rather than suppressed. Our system of production and
exchange is a very great achievement, not more on the
mechanical side than in the social possibilities latent in
it. Our next task seems to be to fulfil these possibilities,
to enlarge and humanize the system by bringing it under
the guidance of a comprehensive social and ethical policy.</p>

MEN</p>

<p class='c010'>To make clear what I mean by progress in pecuniary
valuation, let me recall something of the nature of values
in general and of the relation of the various kinds to one
another.</p>

<p class='c013'>Value is an expression of organization. The power
of an object to influence a man, or any other form of life,
depends upon the established tendencies of that form of
life, and, accordingly, wherever we find a system of
values there is always a mental or social organization of
some kind corresponding to it. Thus in the simpler
provinces of the mind there are taste-values, touch-values,
and smell-values, corresponding to our physiological
organization. In a higher sphere we have intellectual
and feeling values of many kinds, shown in our
differential conduct as regards persons, books, pictures,
theories, or other influencing objects, and indicating organized
habits of thought and sentiment. So in the
larger or societal phase of life we see that each organized
tendency, the prevailing fashion, the dominant church
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>or state, a school of literature or painting, the general
spirit of an epoch, involves a corresponding system of
values. You prefer Monet to David, or the German
view of the war to the English view, or the present style
of dress to hoop-skirts, because you are in one or another
of these tendencies.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are many ways of classifying values. In general,
the kinds are innumerable and their relations intricate:
taken as a whole they express the diversity and complex
interdependence of life itself.</p>

<p class='c010'>The question as to what are the differences among the
various sorts of value, as moral, æsthetic, legal, religious,
or economic, is answered, in general, by saying that they
express differentiated phases of the social system. If the
phase is definitely organized we can usually ascertain and
distinguish the kind of value in question with corresponding
definiteness; if not, the values remain somewhat indeterminate,
though not necessarily lacking in power.
Thus legal value is a fairly definite thing, because there
is a definite institution corresponding to it and declaring
it from time to time through courts, legislatures, text-book
writers, and the like. How you must draw your
will to make it legally valid is something a lawyer should
be able to tell you with precision. Economic values—if
we understand economic to mean pecuniary—are definite
within the range of an active market. If religious values
mean ecclesiastical, they are easily distinguished; but if
they refer to the inclinations of the religious side of human
nature, they are not readily ascertained, because there is
no definite organization corresponding to them—or if
there is, in the nature of the mind, we know little about
it. The values that are most potent over conduct, among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>which the religious are to be reckoned, are often the least
definable. A psychologist, however, like the late William
James, who wrote a book on the human-nature aspect
of religion, may succeed in defining them more closely.
Much the same may be said of moral and æsthetic values.
In the large human-nature sense, apart from particular
ethical conventions or schools of art, they are of the
utmost interest and moment, indeed, but do not lend
themselves to precise ascertainment.</p>

<p class='c013'>And all of these distinctions among kinds of value,
whether definite or not, are conditioned by the fact that
the various kinds are, after all, differentiated phases of
a common life. It is natural that they should overlap,
that they should be largely aspects rather than separate
things. Values are motives; and we all know that the
classification of a man’s motives as economic, ethical, or
æsthetic is somewhat formal and arbitrary. The value
to me of an engraving I have just bought may be æsthetic,
or economic, or perhaps ostentatious, or ethical.
(We see in Ruskin’s writings how easily an æsthetic value
becomes ethical if one takes it seriously.) It may well
be all these: my impulse to cherish it is a whole with
various aspects.</p>

<p class='c013'>In much the same way society at large has its various
institutions and tendencies, expressing themselves in
values, which are more or less distinct but whose operation
you cannot wholly separate in a given case. The
distinctions among them are in the nature of organic
differentiations within a whole.</p>

<p class='c010'>Observe, next, that there is a sort of commensurability
throughout the world of values, multifarious as it is. I
mean that in a vague but real way we are accustomed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>to weigh one kind of value against another and to guide
our conduct by the decision. Apart from any definite
medium of exchange there is a system of mental barter,
as you might call it, in universal operation, by which
values are compared definitely enough to make choice
possible. You may say that the things that appeal to us
are often so different in kind that it is absurd to talk of
comparing them; but as a matter of fact we do it none
the less. We choose between the satisfaction of meeting
a friend at the station and that of having our dinner at
the usual time, between spending an hour of æsthetic
improvement at the Metropolitan Museum and one of
humanitarian expansion at the University Settlement,
between gratifying our sense of honor by returning an
excess of change and our greed by keeping it, between
the social approbation to be won by correct dress and
bearing and the physical ease of slouchiness. Almost
any sort of value may come, in practice, to be weighed
against almost any other sort.</p>

<p class='c013'>Indeed this is implied in the very conception of value
as that which has weight or worth in guiding behavior.
Our behavior is a kind of synthesis of the ideas, or values,
that are working in us in face of a given situation, and
these may be any mixture that life supplies. The result
is that almost any sort of value may find itself mixed up
and synthetized with any other sort.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the human mind, ever developing its instruments,
has come to supplement this psychical barter of values
by something more precise, communicable and uniform,
and so we arrive at pecuniary valuation. This is in some
respects analogous to language, serving for organization
and growth through more exact communication; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>just as language develops a system of words, of means of
record (writing, printing, and the like), also of schools,
and, withal, a literary and learned class to have special
charge of the institution, so pecuniary valuation has its
money, banks, markets, and its business class.</p>

<p class='c013'>For our present purpose of discussing the general relation
of pecuniary to other values, as æsthetic or ethical,
it is of no great importance, I should say, to inquire minutely
into the various kinds of the latter or their precise
relations to one another. The large fact to bear in mind,
in this connection, is that we have, on the one hand, a
world of psychical values, whose reality is shown in their
power to influence conduct, and, on the other, a world of
prices, which apparently exists to give all kinds of psychical
value general validity and exact expression, but which
seems to do this in a partial and inadequate manner.</p>

<p class='c013'>This, indeed, may be called the root of the whole matter:
the fact that pecuniary value, whose functions of
extension, of precision, of motivation, of organization,
are so essential and should be so beneficent, appears in
practice to ignore or depreciate many kinds of value, and
these often the highest, by withholding pecuniary recognition;
and, on the other hand, to create or exaggerate
values which seem to have little or no human merit to
justify such appraisal. Let us, then, inquire why its interpretation
of life is so warped.</p>

<p class='c010'>The answer to this I take to be, in general, that pecuniary
valuation is achieved through an institutional
process, and, like all things, bears the marks of its genesis.
There are institutional conditions that intervene between
psychical values and their pecuniary expression. These
are, roughly, of two sorts, those that operate after pecuniary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>demand is formed, within the processes of exchange,
and those that operate antecedently to the actual demand,
in the larger social process. The former are technical
conditions within the economic organization, and are
studied by political economists; the latter spring from the
social organization as a whole, and are usually regarded
as outside the province of economics.</p>

<p class='c013'>I may illustrate these two sorts of conditions by considering
the pecuniary value of a work of art. Thus if a
sculptor cannot sell his product for a price commensurate
with its merit, this may be because, owing to lack of information,
he has not come into touch with the market,
although the market may be a good one. He has not found
the group of buyers willing to pay what his work is worth.
On the other hand, it may be because, owing to social conditions
involving a low state of taste, there <em>is</em> no such
group.</p>

<p class='c013'>The former phase of the matter, since it lies within
the familiar provinces of economics, I need not say
much about. We all know that the processes of competition
and exchange do not correspond to the economic
ideal; that they are impaired by immobility, ignorance,
monopoly, lack of intelligent organization, and other well-known
defects. How serious these are, on the whole, I
need not now inquire, but will pass on to those considerations
that go behind pecuniary demand, and indicate
why this is itself no trustworthy expression of the human
values actually working in the minds of men at a given
time.</p>

<p class='c010'>Most conspicuous among them, perhaps, is the factor
of class. The pecuniary market taken as a whole, with
its elaborate system of money, credit, bargaining, accounting,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>forecasting of demand, business administration,
and so on, involving numerous recondite functions,
requires the existence of a technical class, which stands
in the same relation to the pecuniary institution as the
clergy, politicians, lawyers, doctors do to other institutions;
that is, they have an intimate knowledge and
control of the system which enables them to guide its
working in partial independence of the rest of society.
They do this partly to the end of public service and
partly to their own private advantage; all technical
classes, in one way or another, exploiting the institutions
in their charge for their own aggrandizement. If
the clergy have done this, we may assume that other
classes will also: indeed it is mostly unconscious and involves
no peculiar moral reproach. Much also is done
that cannot be called exploitation, which may greatly
affect values. The commercially ascendant class has not
only most of the tangible power, but the prestige and initiative
which, for better or worse, may be even more
influential. It sets fashions, perhaps of fine ideals, perhaps
of gross dissipations, which permeate society and
control the market.</p>

<p class='c013'>To this we must, of course, add the concentration of
actual buying power in the richer class, which is largely
the same as the commercial class. The general result is
that psychical values, in the course of getting pecuniary
expression, pass through and are moulded by the minds
of people of wealth and business function to an extent
not easily overstated.</p>

<p class='c013'>In close connection with this factor of class we have
the existence of certain legal institutions, of which the
rights of inheritance and bequest are the most conspicuous,
that enormously aid the concentration of pecuniary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>power, and hence of control over pecuniary values, in a
comparatively small group. However defensible these
rights may be, all things considered, it is the simple truth
that the concentration and continuity they appear to
involve seriously discredit, in practice, all theories of
economic freedom, and make it necessary to look for the
pecuniary recognition of values largely to the good-will
of the class that has most of the pecuniary power. The
view that the administration of the value system can be
in any sense democratic must rest, under these conditions,
upon the belief that democratic ideals will permeate
the class in question, in spite of its somewhat
oligarchic position.</p>

<p class='c013'>Let us not forget, however, that class-control, of some
kind or degree, lies in the nature of organization, so that
its presence in the pecuniary institution is nothing extraordinary.
Whether, or in what respects, it is an evil calling
for reform, I shall not now consider.</p>

<p class='c010'>Interwoven with the influence of class is that of the
institutional process, of the fact that pecuniary valuation
works through an established mechanism, and that
it can translate into pecuniary terms only such values
as have conformed to certain conditions. In general,
values can be expressed in the market only as they have
become the object of extended recognition in some exchangeable
form, and so of regular pecuniary competition.
To attain to this they must be felt in the organized
opinion of a considerable social group, from which
the competitors are to come, and they must also, in a
measure, be standardized; that is, the degrees and kinds
of value must be defined, so that regular and precise
transactions are possible.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>Suppose that we consider again the case of the sculptor,
and assume that he is a young man who has begun
to produce statues of a high and unique æsthetic
worth. In order that these shall have a pecuniary value
adequate to their merit, it is not sufficient that here and
there an isolated critic or connoisseur shall be strongly
impressed by them. Such a situation does not establish
a market: there must be discussion, a continuous communicating
group must arise, including connoisseurs
and wealthy amateurs subject to their influence, the
merits of the painter and of his several works must
be in a manner conventionalized, so that regular competition
is set up and a continuous series of prices
established.</p>

<p class='c013'>A better illustration, for some purposes, would be one
in which the social group includes both consumers and
producers, the latter stimulated by the appreciation of
the group, and at the same time contributing to it by
expert leadership, the group as a whole thus advancing
both the type of values and its pecuniary standing. This
might be the case with the painter and his public, but
perhaps expert golf-players and the makers of golf-clubs
would be a better example. I suppose that the sport is
socially organized, in the sense just indicated, and that
this enables a regular progress in function and in its pecuniary
recognition. The makers turn out better and
better clubs and get well paid for them. Almost any
branch of applied science will also afford good illustrations,
as mechanical engineering, or the manufacture of
electrical apparatus.</p>

<p class='c013'>Something of this kind must take place with all new
values seeking pecuniary expression. It is not enough
that they are felt by individuals, no matter how many,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>in a vague and scattered way: they must achieve a kind
of system.</p>

<p class='c010'>To put it otherwise, <em>the progress of market valuation,
as a rule, is a translation into pecuniary terms of values
which have already become, in some measure, a social institution</em>.
A new design in dress, no matter how attractive,
means nothing on the market until it has become
the fashion (or is believed to be in a way to become so);
then you can hardly buy anything else; and the principle
is of wide application. Inventions and discoveries,
however pregnant, will commonly have no market standing
except as they have an evident power to contribute
to pecuniary values already established. If you write
an original treatise in some branch of science, you are
lucky if it pays the cost of publication, but if you can
prepare a text-book that meets the institutional demand
for the same science, you may look for affluence.</p>

<p class='c013'>Or, to apply the principle to the highest sphere of all,
there is a sense in which it is true that the greater a
moral value is the less is its pecuniary recognition. That
is, if righteous innovation, the moral heroism of the
heretics who foreshadow better institutions, is the greatest
good, then the greater the good the less the pay.
This is not because moral value is essentially non-pecuniary—people
will pay for righteousness as readily, perhaps,
as for anything else, when they feel it as such, and
when it presents itself in negotiable form—but because
pecuniary valuation is essentially an institution, and
values which are anti-institutional naturally stand outside
of it.</p>

<p class='c013'>A value that is standard in a powerful institution never
fails, I think, of pecuniary recognition. In a certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>church a certain type of clergyman can get a good salary:
to understand why, you must study the history of the
institution.</p>

<p class='c013'>You may say that this is contrary to the well-known
fact that a high premium is everywhere put upon initiative
and originality. But if you look closer you will find
that these qualities, in order to be well paid, must have
a demonstrable power to enhance pecuniary values already
on the market. An advertising man with a genius
for novel and efficacious appeal may demand a great
salary, but if he devotes the same genius to radical agitation
he may not be allowed to hold any job at all. It
is possible, no doubt, to extend considerably the means
by which fruitful originality is anticipated and pecuniary
recognition prepared for it, as is done, for example, in
the endowment of research. The trouble here is to provide
any standard of originality which shall not become
conventional, and so, in practice, merely perpetuate an
institution. Even the endowment of research, like fellowships
in theological institutions, has in some degree this
effect.</p>

<p class='c013'>We hear a great deal nowadays to the effect that the
values of scholars and teachers lack pecuniary appreciation
and security in the universities, that boards of trustees
do not understand the finer kinds of merit and often
use the funds under their control to employ men of business
or administrative capacity rather than in evoking or
attracting notable men of the type to further which universities
exist; also that men are under pressure (indirectly
pecuniary) not to teach anything repugnant to the
ascendant commercialism, which the authorities unconsciously
represent. In so far as this is true the remedy
would seem to be to define and promote the type, to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>clear in academic groups and in public opinion what the
higher merits are, so that every board will be intelligently
eager to secure them; in a word, to foster the institution,
in the highest sense, and insist that complete freedom of
function shall be a part of it.</p>

<p class='c013'>So the question of social betterment, in terms of valuation,
is largely a question of imparting to the psychical
values that we believe to represent betterment such precision
and social recognition as shall give them pecuniary
standing, and add the inducement of market demand to
whatever other forces may be working for their realization.
There are, of course, other methods which may be
of equal or greater efficacy; but this is one with which
no reform can altogether dispense. Thus the movement
which is making “social work” a regular profession, with
definite requirements of capacity and training, established
methods and ideals, and a market price in the way
of salaries for those that are competent, is a momentous
thing in this field. Not only does it mean pecuniary
recognition for the humanitarian value of individuals,
but, through the institution of a class having such values
at heart, all kinds of ideas and measures working in this
direction are assured of organized support. The new
profession should do for its province what the legal profession
(in spite of shortcomings) does for justice, or the
medical for health. No doubt something is lost in passing
from the heroic innovator to the standard worker on
a salary; but it is thus that we get ahead, and that the
way is opened for higher kinds of innovation.</p>

<p class='c010'>If we wish a general term to bring out the antithesis
between pecuniary values and those which are high,
psychically, but non-pecuniary, we may call the latter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span><em>progress-values</em>. Progress-values, in this somewhat arbitrary
sense, would be those which are not yet incorporated
into the pecuniary institution, but which, because of
their intrinsic worth to human life, deserve to be, and
presumably will be. As that takes place they will, of
course, cease to be progress-values, because the pecuniary
institution will have caught up with them. Such values,
otherwise regarded, may be æsthetic, scientific, moral,
industrial; may in fact pertain to any field of life which
admits of progress. The labor-saving invention which
no one, as yet, is willing to pay for has an industrial
progress-value, and similarly with the paintings of Corot
before the appreciating group has made a market for
them.</p>

<p class='c013'>It will be understood that the more obvious examples
of non-pecuniary progress-values are to be expected in
those social processes which are remote from or opposed
to the economic institution, so that pecuniary recognition
is correspondingly impeded. In literature, science,
and religion they are ever conspicuous (in retrospect,
that is), and still more so in what relates to those fundamental
social reforms of which the pecuniary system, as
a part of the establishment, is the natural enemy.</p>

<p class='c013'>I need hardly add that progress-values belong, like
moral and æsthetic values, among those which have
power over the human spirit, but which, for the very
reason that they are not the expression of a definite institution,
cannot be precisely ascertained.</p>

<p class='c010'>Probably the more flagrant shortcomings of market
valuation at the present time are due in part to a rather
anarchic state of the economic system itself, considered
as a mechanism, but also, quite as much, to a weakness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>and confusion in the higher kinds of organization, of
which economic demand should be the expression. The
market is largely under the control of two sorts of values,
both of which may be called anti-progressive: institutional
values of a somewhat outworn and obstructive
kind, and human-nature values whose crudity reflects the
present lack among us of the finer kinds of culture groups
and disciplines. By outworn institutional values I mean,
for example, the ideals of pecuniary self-assertion and
display which we get, at least in their more extravagant
forms, from the regnant commercialism; also the ideals
of a superficial refinement, expressing social superiority
rather than beauty, which we inherit from a society based
on caste. Crude human-nature values may be illustrated
by the various forms of sensuality and unedifying amusement
for which we spend so lavishly. The road to something
higher, in both these regards, seems to lie through
the growth of such group disciplines as I have suggested.</p>

<p class='c013'>We particularly need such disciplines in those fields of
production which are most distinctly economic in that
they are most completely within the control of the pecuniary
institution—production, chiefly, of material
goods for the ordinary uses of life. At the present time
producers, in great part, are guided by no ideals of group
function and service, but merely by the commercial principle
of making what they can sell. This attitude is anti-progressive,
however matter-of-course it may seem, because
the social group in performance of a given function
is primarily responsible for its betterment. A shoe-manufacturer
is no more justified in making the worst shoes
he can sell than an artist in painting the worst pictures.
Only as we all idealize our functions can progress-values
come in. And the consumers, upon whom the commercial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>principle throws the whole responsibility, also
lack high standards, and organized means of enforcing
those they have. The whole situation, so far as it is of
this kind, tends to the degradation of quality.</p>

<p class='c010'>Production has not always lacked ideals, nor does it
everywhere lack them at present. They come when the
producing group gets a corporate consciousness and a
sense of the social worth of its function. The mediæval
guilds developed high traditions and standards of workmanship,
and held their members to them. They thought
of themselves in terms of service, and not merely as purveyors
to a demand. In our time the same is to some
extent true of trades and professions in which a sense of
workmanship has been developed by tradition and training.
Doctors and lawyers are not content to give us
what we want in their line, but hold it their duty to teach
us what we ought to want, to refuse things that are not
for our best good and urge upon us those that are. Artists,
teachers, men of letters, do the same. A good carpenter,
if you give him the chance, will build a better
house than the owner can appreciate; he loves to do it
and feels obscurely that it is his part to realize an ideal of
sound construction. The same principle ought to hold
good throughout society, each functional group forming
ideals of its own function and holding its members to
them. Consuming and producing groups should co-operate
in this matter, each making requirements which
the other might overlook. The somewhat anarchical condition
that is now common we may hope to be transitory.
The general rule is that a stable group has a tendency to
create for itself ideals of service in accord with the ruling
ideals of society at large.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>Perhaps we shall succeed in achieving the higher values
only as we embody them in a system of appealing images
by the aid of art. We need to <em>see</em> society—see it beautiful
and inspiring—as a whole and in its special meaning
for us, building up the conception of democracy until it
stands before us with the grandeur and detail of great
architecture. Then we shall have a source of higher
values from which the pecuniary channels, as well as
others, will be fed.<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c014'><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The societies of the past have done this in their own
way; they have had the state and the church, heroes,
dignitaries, traditions and symbols, a visible whole which
engaged the devotion of men and served as the spring of
ideal values. Montesquieu, with his eyes on France,
wrote that honor was the principle of monarchy, which
“sets all the parts of the body politic in motion,” the
fount of honor being the king, and its awards depending,
ideally, on public service, as that was understood at the
time. We must do it in a new way, our own democratic
way; but it must be done. There must be the ideals,
the symbols, the devotion, the detailed and cogent interpretation
for every phase of life.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is not hard to find going on about us examples of
the way in which an onward movement, expressing itself
in any of the social institutions, may pass thence into the
pecuniary system. Consider, for instance, the movement
for vocational selection and specialized education in the
schools. It is evident that the spirit of our democracy
is bent on developing competent leadership and technical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>efficiency in all phases of its higher life. As this idea becomes
organized it creates a demand for teachers and
specialists of every sort which the growth of society is
seen to require, and prices are set upon their services
high enough to insure the supply. If the public mind
sees the need of forestry, a supply of trained foresters,
sufficiently well paid, is presently at hand. These in
turn, acting as leaders, stimulate and guide public opinion,
and a growth of organization and of values takes
place along the line of vital impulse.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of the same character is the rise and effectuation of
an art spirit, which we are witnessing. The public mind,
somewhat weary of a monotonous commercialism, has
begun to turn, vaguely but resolutely, toward æsthetic
production and enjoyment. There are a hundred manifestations
of this, but none more significant than the rise
of art-handicraft teaching in the schools. No one can
say how far this will go, but there is no apparent reason
why it should stop short of restoring that union of life
with art which our recent development has so generally
destroyed. If so, the effect in creating higher types of
commercial value, in commodities and in men, will be
beyond estimate. The spirit of art makes men desire to
surround themselves with objects upon which the craftsman
has impressed a joyous personal feeling, precisely as
the lover of literature needs to surround himself with
books of which this is true. It is essentially a demand
for personal expression, and implies a real, though perhaps
indirect, understanding between the workman and
the consumer. In so far, then, as it prevails it evokes a
class of handicraftsmen whose work is individual and inspiriting,
partly counteracting the deadening effect of
wholesale and impersonal methods. Thus there will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>come to be a growing number of independent and well-paid
men, many of them dealing directly with the consumer,
engaged upon work as delightful as any that life
affords.</p>

<p class='c013'>Wholesale production will doubtless continue, because
of its economy, but even as regards this we note that
variety and personal interest in the work are coming to
have a market value as they are seen to promote contentment
and efficiency in the worker.</p>

<p class='c013'>The whole matter of fashion, especially of fashion in
dress, might well be discussed from this point of view.
Although it has been the subject of futile satire and protest
so long as to seem hopeless, it is not so unless we are
prepared to admit that we are incapable of a real self-expression
in this part of life. Competent leadership,
along with the general growth of æsthetic culture and
democratic sentiment, should make this possible.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is plain, also, that in any plan of reform of values
through demand the mind of women must have a great
part. In so far as this mind seems at present to fluctuate
between conventionalism and anarchy, the cause,
perhaps, is that it lacks the guidance and discipline that
might come from the better organization of women as a
social group. The working of this should be analogous
to that of the professional groups I have cited, and
should have a like power to raise the quality of the pecuniary
values which women control. The critical question
here is, will women, under conditions of freedom,
develop a group consciousness of their own, with high
ideals of each function and power to discipline the less
responsible of their sex. It is hard to see how modern
civilization can dispense with something of this kind.
We seem to have abandoned compulsory discipline, and
self-discipline is much needed to take its place—or rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>to do what the other could never have done: make women
full participants in democratic progress.</p>

<p class='c010'>As regards a better pecuniary valuation of men, the
same principles hold, in general, as for other kinds of
pecuniary progress. It calls for the development of service
values, along with the social organization necessary
to appreciate and define these and secure for them pecuniary
recognition. No social manipulation can be trusted
to make people pay high prices for poor service, nor will
good service secure an adequate reward without social
structure to back it. The natural process is one of the
concomitant development, through a continuing group,
of service values and pecuniary appreciation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Certainly we need a scientific and thoroughgoing cultivation
of personal productive power. This should include
the study of potential capacity in children, vocational
guidance, practical training, and social culture.
We require also a practical eugenics, which shall diminish
the propagation of degenerate types and perhaps
apply more searching tests to immigrants. We need, in
short, a comprehensive “scientific management” of mankind,
to the end of better personal opportunity and social
function in every possible line. But inseparable from this
is the whole question of democratic social development
through the state and other institutions, every phase of
which should tend to improve the general position, and
through that the market power, of the unprivileged masses
of the people.</p>

<p class='c013'>To put it otherwise, the institutional forces supporting
market values vary not only in different occupation
groups, but along lines of general class position, and in
the case of those classes that are handicapped by an unfavorable
economic situation the weakness of these forces
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>offers an urgent problem, which the labor movement, in
the largest sense, is an endeavor to solve.</p>

<p class='c013'>I do not anticipate that the struggle of classes over
pecuniary distribution will go to any great extremes. It
seems more probable that facility of intercourse, democratic
education, underlying community of interest, and
the large human spirit that is growing upon us, will maintain
a working solidarity. Common ideals of some sort
will pervade the whole people; and they cannot be ideals
dictated by any one class. They must be such as can
be made acceptable to an intelligent democracy, and will
rule the minds of rich and poor alike; no class will be able
to shut them out. They will be violated, but only in the
clandestine way that all accepted principles are violated.
Whoever has wealth, whoever has power, I am inclined
to think that the sway of the public mind will be such
as to insure the use of these, in the main, for what is regarded
as the common welfare.</p>

<p class='c013'>In spite of the rank growth of many abuses, our society
is comparatively free from the more stubborn obstacles
to democratic betterment. I mean long-settled
habits and traditions whose spirit is opposed to such
betterment. Our theory, our formal organization, our
training, are all favorable to rational democracy. The
domination of a commercial class, so far as it exists, is
but a mushroom growth, and those who, to their own
surprise, find themselves exercising it, have no deep belief
in its justice or permanence. It is an economic fact,
but not a tradition or a faith. It is but a slight thing
compared with the indurated mediævalism and militarism
of Europe. Our people have not only democratic
ideals, but a well-grounded faith in their ability to realize
them.</p>

<p class='c012'>INTELLIGENCE AS FORESIGHT—A TENTATIVE PROCESS—A PHASE OF
THE SOCIAL PROCESS—GROUP INTELLIGENCE—INTELLIGENT
PROCESS INCLUDES THE WHOLE MIND—ITS DRAMATIC CHARACTER—RELATION
TO DRAMATIC LITERATURE—MODERN ENLARGEMENT
OF INTELLIGENT PROCESS</p>

<p class='c010'>The test of intelligence is the power to act successfully
in new situations. We judge a man to be intelligent
when we see that in going through the world he is not
guided merely by routine or second-hand ideas, but that
when he meets a fresh difficulty he thinks out a fresh line
of action appropriate to it, which is justified by its success.
We value the faculty because it does succeed, because in
the changing world of human life we feel a constant need
for it. In animal existence, where situations repeat themselves
day after day, and generation after generation,
with practical uniformity, a successful method of behavior
may be worked out by unintelligent adaptation,
and may become fixed in instinct or habit, but the power
to deal effectively with intricate and shifting forces belongs
to intelligence alone.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is, then, essentially a kind of foresight, a mental reaction
that anticipates the operation of the forces at work
and is prepared in advance to adjust itself to them. How
is this possible when the situation is a new one whose
working cannot have been observed in the past?</p>

<p class='c013'>The answer is that the situation is new only as a whole,
and that it always has elements whose operation is familiar.
Intelligence is the power to anticipate how these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>elements will work in a novel combination: it is a power
of grasp, of synthesis, of constructive vision.<a id='r75'></a><a href='#f75' class='c014'><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>It does not dispense with experience. A man who can
take hold of a new undertaking and make it go will commonly
be a man who has prepared himself by previous
undertakings of a similar character: the more pertinent
experience he has had the better. If he is opening a business
agency in a strange city he will require a general
acquaintance with the business, such as he might gain
at the home office, and will do well also to learn all he can
in advance about the city into which he goes. But beyond
this he will need the power to take a fresh, understanding
view of the situation as he actually finds it,
the state of the market, the people with whom he deals
and the like, so as to perceive their probable working in
relation to his own designs.</p>

<p class='c013'>Intelligence, then, is based on memories, but makes a
free and constructive use of these, as distinguished from
a mechanical use. By an act of mental synthesis it
grasps the new combination as a going whole and foresees
how it must work. It apprehends life through an
inner organizing process of its own, corresponding to the
outward process which it needs to interpret, but working
in advance of the latter and anticipating the outcome.</p>

<p class='c013'>You might say that memory supplies us with a thousand
motion-picture films showing what has happened in
given sets of circumstances in the past. Now, when a
new set of circumstances occurs the unintelligent mind
picks out a film that shows something in common with it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>and, expecting a repetition of that film, guides its course
accordingly. The intelligent mind, however, surveying
many old films, is content with none of them, but by a
creative synthesis imagines a new film answering more
closely to the new situation, and foreshowing more nearly
what will happen. It is a work of art, depicting what
never was on sea or land, yet more like the truth than
anything actually experienced.</p>

<p class='c013'>I conceive that no mechanical theory of intelligence
can be other than illusive. It is essentially a process of
dealing with the unknown, of discovery. After its operations
have taken place they may, perhaps, be formulated;
but they can be predicted in advance only by the parallel
operation of another intelligence. Behavior which can
be formulated in advance is not, in any high sense, intelligent.</p>

<p class='c010'>Even the intelligence, however, works by a tentative
method; it has to feel its way. Its superiority lies in the
fewness and effectiveness of its experiments. Our mental
staging of what is about to happen is almost never completely
true, but it approaches the truth, in proportion
as we are intelligent, so that our action comes somewhere
near success, and we can the more easily make the necessary
corrections. Napoleon did not always foresee how
military operations would work out, but his prevision
was so much more nearly correct than that of other generals
that his rapid and sure experiments led to almost
certain victory. In a similar manner Darwin felt his way
among observations and hypotheses, proving all things
and holding fast what was good, going slowly but surely
up a road where others could make no headway at all.
It is the same, I believe, with composers, sculptors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>painters, and poets: their occasionally rapid accomplishment
is the fruit of a long discipline in trial and error.</p>

<p class='c010'>This selection and organization in the intelligent mind
is also a participation in the social process. As the mental
and the social are merely phases of the same life, this
hardly needs proof, but an illustration will do no harm.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suppose, then, I am considering whether to send my
son away from home to a certain college. Here is a
problem for my intelligence, and it is also a social problem,
a situation in a drama wherein my son and I and
others are characters, my aim being to understand and
guide its development so that it may issue as I wish. I
bring before my mind all that I have been able to learn
about the teachers at the college, the traditions and surrounding
influences, as well as the disposition and previous
history of the boy, striving all the time to see how things
will develop if I do send him, and how this will be related
to my own wishes for his welfare. The better I
can do this the more likely I am to act successfully in
the premises. The whole procedure is a staging in my
mind of a scene in the life of society.</p>

<p class='c010'>The process that goes on in a case like this is the work
not only of my own private mind but of a social group.
My information comes to me through other people, and
they share in forming my ideas. Quite probably I discuss
the matter with my friends; certainly with my wife:
it may be matter for a family council. Intelligence works
through a social process.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is easy, then, to pass from what seems to be an act
of merely private intelligence through a series of steps
by which it becomes distinctly public or societal. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>deliberations of a family council differ only in continuity
of organization from those of a wide nation, with newspapers,
legislatures, and an ancient constitution. There
is nothing exclusively individual about intelligence. It
is part of our social heritage, inseparably bound up with
communication and discussion, and has always functioned
for that common life which embraces the most
cogent interests of the individual. The groups in which
men have lived—the family, the tribe, the clan, the secret
society, the village community, and so on to the multiform
associations of our own time—have had a public
intelligence, working itself out through discussion and
tradition, and illuminating more or less the situations
and endeavors of the group.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is, indeed, a chief function of the institutions of society
to provide an organization on the basis of which
public intelligence may work effectively. They preserve
the results of past experiment and accumulate them about
the principal lines of public endeavor, so that intelligence
working along these lines may use them. They supply
also specialized symbols, traditions, methods of discussion
and decision, for industry, science, literature, government,
art, philosophy and other departments of life.
The growth of intelligence and the growth of a differentiated
social system are inseparable.</p>

<p class='c013'>The movement of this larger or public intelligence is a
social process of somewhat the same character as the less
conscious processes. It is tentative, adaptive, has periods
of conflict and of compromise, and results in progressive
organization. The difference is just that it is more intelligent;
that thinking and planning and forecasting
play a greater part in it, and that there is not so much
waste and misdirection. Its development requires a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>special psychological method, including the initiation of
ideas, discussion, modification, and decision; which of
course is absent on the lower plane of life.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is essential, if we are to have a public intelligence, that
individuals should identify themselves with the public
organism and think from that point of view. If there is
no consciousness of the whole its experiments and adaptations
cannot be truly intelligent, because, as a whole, it
makes no mental synthesis and prevision. A society of
“economic men,” that is, of men who regarded all questions
only from the standpoint of their individual pecuniary
loss or gain, could never be an intelligent whole.
If it worked well, as economists formerly believed that it
would, this would be an unforeseen and unintended result,
not a direct work of intelligence. In fact, during the nineteenth
century England and America went largely upon
the theory that a general intelligence and control were
unnecessary in the economic sphere—with the result that
all competent minds now perceive the theory to be false.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the other hand, the act of larger intelligence need
not take place all at once or in the mind of only one individual.
It is usually co-operative and cumulative, the
work of many individuals, all of them, in some measure,
thinking from the point of view of the whole and building
up their ideas and endeavors in a continuing structure.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus it may be said that in all modern nations the political
life is partly intelligent, because none of them, perhaps,
is without a line of patriots who, generation after
generation, identify their thoughts with the state, discuss
aims and methods with one another, and maintain a tradition
of rational policy. It is so with any organism
which attracts the allegiance of a continuous group.
The church, as a whole and in its several branches, has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>a corporate intelligence maintained in this way, and so
have the various sciences; also, in a measure, political
parties, the fine arts, and the more enduring forms of industrial
organization. Human nature likes to merge
itself in great wholes, and many a corporation is served,
better, perhaps, than it deserves, by men who identify
their spirits with it.</p>

<p class='c010'>It would be a false conception of intelligence to regard
it as something apart from sentiment and passion. It is,
rather, an organization of the whole working of the mind,
a development at the top of a process which remains an
interrelated whole. This is true of its individual aspect;
for our sentiments and passions furnish in great part the
premises with which intelligence works; they are the pigments,
so to speak, with which we paint the picture.
And so with the collective aspect; discussion is far more
than an interchange of ideas; it is also an interaction of
feelings, which are sometimes conveyed by words and
sometimes by gesture, tones, glances of the eye, and by
all sorts of deeds. The obscure impulses that pass from
man to man in this way have quite as much to do with
the building of the collective mind as has explicit reasoning.
The whole psychic current works itself up by complex
interaction and synthesis. And the power of collective
intelligence in a people is not to be measured by dialectic
faculty alone; it rests quite as much upon those
qualities of sense and character which underlie insight,
judgment, and belief. Intelligence, in the fullest sense,
is wisdom, and wisdom draws upon every resource of the
mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is no way of telling whether a people is capable
of intelligent self-direction except by observing that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>practise it. It may be true that certain races or stocks
do not have political capacity in sufficient measure to
meet the needs of modern organization, and will fail to
produce stable and efficient societies. It is a matter of
experiment, and our more optimistic theories may prove
to be unsound.</p>

<p class='c013'>For similar reasons no dividing-line can be drawn between
what is intelligent and what is ethical, however
clearly they may be separated in particular cases. That
is, the intelligent view of situations is a synthetic view
which, if it is only synthetic enough, embracing in one
whole all the human interests at stake, tends to become
an ethical view. Righteousness is the completest intelligence
in action, and we are constantly finding that what
appears intelligent to a narrow state of mind is quite the
opposite when our imaginations expand to take in a wider
range of life. There can be an unmoral kind of intelligence
which is very keen in its way, as, for that matter,
there can be an unintelligent kind of morality which is
very conscientious in its way; but the two tend to coincide
as they become more complete. The question of our
higher development is all one question, of which the intellectual
and moral sides are aspects. We get on by
forming intelligent ideals of right, which are imaginative
reconstructions and anticipations of life, based upon experience.
And in trying to realize these ideals we initiate
a new phase of the social process, which goes on through
the usual interactions to a fresh synthesis.</p>

<p class='c010'>It seems that intelligence, as applied to social life, is
essentially dramatic in character. That is, it deals with
men in all their human complexity, and is required to
forecast how they will act in relation to one another and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>how the situation as a whole will work out. The most intelligent
man is he who can most adequately dramatize
that part of the social process with which he has to deal.
If he is a social worker dealing with a family he needs
not only to sympathize with the members individually,
but to see them as a group in living interaction with one
another and with the neighbors, so that he may know
how any fresh influence he may bring to bear will actually
work. If he is the labor-manager of a factory he must
have insight to see the play of motive going on among
the men, their attitude toward their work, toward the
foreman and toward the “office,” the whole group-psychology
of the situation. In the same way a business
man must see a proposed transaction as a living, moving
whole, with all the parties to it in their true human
characters. I remember talking with an investigator for
one of the great commercial agencies who told me that
in forming his judgment of the reliability of a merchant
he made a practice, after an interview with him, of
imagining him in various critical situations and picturing
to himself how such a man would behave—of dramatizing
him. I think that we all do this in forming our judgments
of people.</p>

<p class='c013'>Or what is the stock-market but a continuous drama,
successful participation in which depends upon the power
to apprehend some phase of it as a moving whole and
foresee its tendency? And so with statesmanship; the
precise knowledge of history or statistics will always and
rightly be subordinate to the higher faculty of inspired
social imagination.</p>

<p class='c010'>The literary drama, including fiction and whatever
other forms have a dramatic character, may be regarded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>as intelligence striving to interpret the social process in
art. It aims to present in comprehensible form some
phase of that cyclical movement of life which otherwise
is apt to seem unintelligible.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the curtain rises we perceive, first of all, a number
of persons, charged with character and reciprocal
tendency, each one standing for something and all together
constituting a dynamic situation. We feel ourselves
in the stress of life; conflict is implicit and expectation
aroused. The play proceeds and the forces begin
to work themselves out; there are interactions, mutual
incitements and adjustments, with a development both
of persons and of the situation at large. At length the
interacting powers arrange themselves more or less distinctly
about a central question, and presently ensues
that struggle for which our expectation is strung; some
decisive clash of human forces, which satisfies our need
to see the thing fought out, and releases our excitement,
to subside, perhaps, in reflection. And presently we have
the <em>dénouement</em>, a final and reconciling situation, a completer
and more stable organization of the forces that were
implicit in the beginning.</p>

<p class='c013'>Conflict is the crisis of drama, as it is of the social
process, and there is hardly any great literature, whether
dramatic in form or not, which is not a literature of conflict.
What would be left of the Bible if you took away
all that is inspired by it; from the Psalms, for instance,
all echoes of the struggles of Israel with other nations,
of upper with lower classes, or of the warring impulses
within the mind of the singer? The power of the story
of Jesus centres about his faith, his courage, his lonely
struggle, his apparent failure, which is yet felt to be a
real success—the Cross. And so one might take Homer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>Dante, Shakespeare’s tragedies, Faust, as well as a thousand
works of the second order, finding conflict at the
heart of all. Without this we are not greatly moved.</p>

<p class='c013'>Each type of society has particular forms of the drama
setting forth what it apprehends as most significant in
its own life. Savages dramatize battle and the chase,
while plays of our own time depict the conflict of industrial
classes, of old ideas and conventions with new ones,
and of the individual with circumstances. The love
game between the sexes—a sort of conflict however you
look at it—is of perennial interest.</p>

<p class='c013'>Forms like the play and the novel should be the most
effective agents of social discussion; and, in fact, the
more searching, in a social and moral sense, are the questions
to be discussed, the more these forms are in demand.
In an ordinary political campaign, where there is little
at issue beyond a personal choice of candidates or some
clash of pecuniary interests, the usual appeals through
newspaper editorials, interviews, and speeches may suffice.
But when people begin to be exercised about really fundamental
matters, such as the ethics of marriage, the ascendancy
of one social class over another, the contact of
races or the significance of vice and crime, they show a
need to see these matters through novels and plays.
The immense vogue of literature of this sort in recent
years is good democracy; in no other way is it possible
to present such questions with so much of living truth,
and yet so simplified as to make a real impression.</p>

<p class='c010'>In recent time there has been a great enlargement of
the intelligent process, which will doubtless continue in
the future. As regards mechanism, this is based on the
extension and improvement of communication, of printing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>telegraphy, rapid travel, illustration, and the like.
These disseminate information and make a wider and
quicker discussion possible. At the same time there appears
to have been an advance in the power of organized
intelligence to interpret life and bring sound judgment
to bear upon actual situations. No one would dispute
the truth of this as regards our dealings with the material
world, nor is there much doubt that it is in some degree
true in the sphere of social relations. We understand
better how life works and should be able to impress a
more rational and humane character on the whole process.
At any rate this, I suppose, is what we are all
striving for.</p>

<p class='c013'>But no achievement of this sort is likely to affect the
preponderance of the unintelligible. You might liken society
to a party of men with lanterns making their way
by night through an immeasurable forest. The light
which the lanterns throw about each individual, and about
the party as a whole, showing them how to guide their
immediate steps, may increase indefinitely, illuminating
more clearly a larger area; but there will always remain,
probably, the plutonian wilderness beyond.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXX<br> <span class='c011'>THE DIVERSIFICATION AND CONFLICT OF IDEAS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>DIVERSIFICATION IN SPECIAL GROUPS—DEMOCRACY VERSUS UNIFORMITY—FREEDOM
OF PROPOSAL AND DISCUSSION—THE VALUE
OF PARTIAL ISOLATION—IMMIGRATION—ORGANIC SELECTION OF
IDEAS—IDEAS THAT DO NOT FIT—TRANSIENT ERRORS—THE
HARMFUL NOT ALWAYS ELIMINATED—THE STRUGGLE OF IDEAS
IN A TIME OF TRANSITION—GETTING DOWN TO PRINCIPLES</p>

<p class='c010'>The movement of intelligence in large social wholes is
an intricate organic process, in which many types of men
participate, and also many traditions and environments
under the influence of which these types of men are
formed. From these diverse points of view come forecasts
and experiments in various directions, accompanied
by a general process of discussion in which all points of
view are modified and a fresh synthesis is worked out.
Thus we think our way along from one stage to another.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly, every group needs to have what we call
in the individual “a fertile mind”; so that, as new situations
arise, a goodly number of intelligent ideas may
spring up to meet them, out of which the best lines of
action may be evolved through the usual methods of discussion
and trial. Thus, if a group of boys have to camp
in a rocky place where no tent-stakes can be driven, their
success in putting up the tent will depend upon having
among their number those whose ingenuity or experience
will suggest good plans for using stones or logs instead of
stakes.</p>

<p class='c013'>We need, then, to encourage the growth of special lines
of tradition and association in order that we may have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>expert guidance. So biologists may suggest plans for
improving the breed of animals and the quality and yield
of crops, bankers schemes of finance, and men trained in
the labor movement methods of conciliation. We cannot
expect to reach high levels of intelligence except
through the medium of functional groups which, by some
adequate process of selection and training have come to
represent as nearly as may be the highest attainable
faculty in a given direction. These groups must be small,
because there must be many of them and because the
members must be specially qualified; but there is nothing
undemocratic in them. Indeed the more democratic
they are, that is, the more selection is based on fair play
and equal opportunity, the more efficient they should be.
It is essential, however, that they should have a continuous
organization, making possible a group spirit and a
regular development through tradition and discussion.
There is no reason why democracy should not express
itself through such groups at least as successfully as any
other form of society.</p>

<p class='c010'>Indeed few things are more obstructive of the understanding
and development of democracy than the popular
idea of it as a uniform mass of individuals without lasting
group distinctions. If it is to work well it must become
differentiated into functional parts, although admission
to these, after suitable training, must be kept
open. The conception of a vast, level proletariat,
which is to work out a uniform social system on the
principle of the greatest good to the greatest number is
not only repellent to all who look toward a richly diversified
culture, but is far from according with the probable
development of democracy. Democracy is primarily an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>increase of consciousness and personal choice in the social
system, which cannot take place except through the
growth of diversity. The higher organic life is based
upon systematic differentiation, and if differences are
functional and adaptive the more we have of them the
better. If our democracy is somewhat uniform, this is a
defect which time, let us hope, will remedy.</p>

<p class='c013'>I believe in democracy, but not in the philosophy by
which it has often been justified. It appeals to me as
on the whole the best means of enfranchising the human
spirit and giving sway to those tendencies and persons
which, being truly strong in a higher sense, are fit to prevail.
I expect that a real democracy will prove to be a
true aristocracy, in which leadership will fall to those fit
by nature and training to exercise it, though I trust
also to the sense and sentiment of the masses. I doubt
whether God is equally represented in all men, as some
maintain, though I believe that the men who represent
him more than others are as likely to be found in a lower
social class as in a higher.</p>

<p class='c010'>The encouragement of recognized lines of special thought
is by no means sufficient. It is equally important that
we have the utmost freedom of proposal and discussion
for projects originating in unforeseen and unaccredited
quarters. The specialist, whether lawyer, economist, biologist,
business man, minister, socialist, anarchist, or
what-not, is, after all, likely to be an expression of what
has already been worked out, an organ of the institution,
not confronting the new situation in the naïve and unbiased
manner which may give value to the views of
people of inferior training.</p>

<p class='c013'>And, moreover, fruitful originality may come quite as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>much from urgent contact with the situation as from
more general knowledge. Workmen in the shop have
suggested innumerable improvements which the designer
in his office would never have thought of; and practicable
ideas of economic and social betterment originate largely
with those who have most reason to feel the wrong of the
actual condition of things. At any rate their point of
view is essential to the formulation of a good plan, and
should have every facility to impress itself upon the general
process of thought.</p>

<p class='c013'>The question of free speech is surrounded by a kind
of illusion, as a result of which we think of it as a matter
that was important in the past, and still is, perhaps, in
other circles of society, but is not so in our own environment.
We are confident, if we think of the matter at all,
that we are not interfering with free speech, nor are any
of those other liberal-minded people our friends and
associates.</p>

<p class='c013'>But this is what people have always believed. We
know how humane and broad-minded the Emperor
Marcus Aurelius was, and also how he regretted the turbulence
of the Christians and the severity he felt compelled
to use toward them—the same occurrences which
have come down to us in the Christian tradition as martyrdoms.
Torquemada, of the Spanish Inquisition, was
a humane and liberal-minded man in his own view and
that of his associates, and so were the burners of witches,
the German officials in Belgium, and indeed nearly all of
those we look upon as persecutors.</p>

<p class='c013'>The plain truth is that we are all engaged with more or
less energy in endeavoring to force upon others those
modes of thought and behavior which we, as a result of
our habit and environment, have come to look upon as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>decent and necessary. This is all that Torquemada did,
and we, as I say, are doing no less. The main difference
is that we have become more humane in our methods of
suppression, and even somewhat aware, vaguely and intermittently,
of the illusion of which I speak, so that we
are inclined to admit, especially in matters remote from
ourselves, the importance of insisting upon freedom of
speech.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is indeed a matter for eternal vigilance and courage,
not only in resisting the unconscious encroachments of
others but in keeping our own minds open and tolerant.
The question is a very real one in American universities,
where ideas that shock prevalent habits of thought can
hardly be advocated without resisting social and academic
pressure, and, perhaps, endangering one’s position,
or advancement that might otherwise be expected.
This was true thirty or forty years ago as regards the
doctrine of evolution; it was true quite recently as regards
socialism; it is true now of other social and economic
heresies, such as birth-control, pacifism, or what-not,
that in time may become entirely respectable.</p>

<p class='c013'>The need of tolerance has been greatly increased by
the rise of a social system which aims to be intelligent,
recognizes change as rational, and seeks to guide it by
discussion. Under an older régime, as in the Middle
Ages, the prevalent doctrine was that there could be but
one right way of thinking and that others must be suppressed.
And in a society not organized for discussion
there was more truth in this than the modern reader of
history is apt to admit. A thousand years ago freedom
of religious teaching, for example, would probably have
resulted in doctrinal and moral anarchy. Innumerable
conflicting sects would have sprung up, and there was no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>general organization of thought vigorous enough to keep
them within limits or maintain a voluntary unity. In
this, as in many other fields, we can dispense with a compulsory
discipline because we have developed one which
is spontaneous: formerly, if there was to be a moral
whole it had to be authoritative. Even now this is more
or less true of unenlightened populations, and it is only
along with a campaign for enlightenment that we can
safely demand freedom of speech.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is essential to the intelligent conduct of society that
radical groups, however small and unpopular, should
develop and express their views. Their proposals do good
by forcing the discussion of principles and so leading to
an illumination otherwise impossible. The large and
moderate parties have a conforming tendency and usually
differ but little in principles, if indeed they are conscious
of these at all. But the radical programme is a challenge
to thought, and can hardly fail to be educative.
For some time past the Socialists have been of the utmost
service in this way, and round their searching theories
of human betterment discussion has largely centred. I
have often been impressed by their value as a factor in
clarifying the minds of college students. Such theories
are like the occupation of an advanced post by a detachment
of an army: they push forward the line of battle
even if the position occupied does not, in the long run,
prove tenable. We easily overlook the fact that an honest
project is seldom wholly wrong, and that even if it
is there may be profit in discussing it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The value of partial isolation as a factor in social intelligence
is not often recognized in a democracy, where,
under the sway of the brotherhood idea, we commonly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>assume that we cannot see too much of one another.
But if we are to have a rich organization of thought, including
many types of men, each good of its kind, we must
have a corresponding diversity of environments in which
these types of men may get their nurture. The culture
of individuality, the need of which we are beginning to
recognize, cannot go far except as we also foster distinctive
groups. We need many kinds of family, of school,
of church, of community, of occupational and culture
associations, each with a tradition and spirit of its own.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is much to be said in favor of our schools and
universities entering heartily into the lives of the communities
that surround them; but if the communities
are of a spirit hostile or indifferent to culture they may,
and partly do, submerge the latter in their own barbarism.
The democratization of higher traditions must be on a
plane of militant leadership, not of concession, or it is
pernicious. Better a real culture, though in monasteries,
than a general vulgarization.</p>

<p class='c013'>The same considerations may serve to qualify our
democratic criticism of hereditary wealth and of the class
differences based upon it. The man with an inherited
competence is in a position to separate himself from the
rush of competition enough to make a fresh estimate of
things, and to use his independence as a fulcrum for starting
a new movement. No doubt the great majority fail
to do this; it requires other qualifications than pecuniary;
still, much fruitful initiative in science, art, literature and
social reform has in fact been supplied by people having
this advantage, and until we provide for leisure and independence
in some other way the argument for hereditary
wealth will have force. In the same way the
finest ideals of life and conduct—as distinguished, possibly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>from the highest ideals—have often been the tradition
of an upper class, upon which their continuance
depended. If we are to dispense with upper classes we
must at the same time provide for continuous culture
groups of a more democratic sort.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is much the same with national variation as with
that of individuals and groups. Bagehot, in the earliest
and perhaps the ablest attempt to apply Darwinism to
society, pointed out that “all great nations have been
prepared in privacy and in secret. They have been composed
far away from all distraction. Greece, Rome, Judea,
were framed each by itself, and the antipathy of each to
men of different race and different speech is one of their
most marked peculiarities, and quite their strongest
common property.”<a id='r76'></a><a href='#f76' class='c014'><sup>[76]</sup></a> In modern life, however, as nations
come to share consciously and with good-will in a common
organic life, this differentiation should not be one of isolation
or antipathy, but of pride in a distinctive contribution
to the higher life of the world. I need hardly add
that the independence and individuality of small nations—which
has seemed to be threatened—is essential to the
general good.</p>

<p class='c010'>Immigration is another topic that might well be considered
from the standpoint of variety of ideas. We need
as many kinds of people as possible, provided they are
good kinds, because their various temperaments and capacities
enrich our life. This seems true biologically, as
regards diversity of natural stocks, and applies also to
the ideals and habits of thought that immigrants bring
with them. Our self-esteem naturally depreciates these
contributions, but it is fairly clear that after a long course
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>of pioneer life and crude industrialism we are in a position
to profit by culture elements that even the peasantry of
an older civilization may supply. The Slavs, Italians,
Jews, and others who have recently come to America in
such numbers have many things to learn from us, but
beyond doubt they have also much to teach.</p>

<p class='c013'>Certainly it is a mistake to attempt to suppress
foreign customs or languages by any kind of coercion.
It is true that a common language, at least, is necessary
to assimilation, but this will come naturally if our
social attitude is hospitable and our schools efficient.
Moreover, a too sudden or compulsory break with the
past is a bad thing, impairing self-respect and stability
of character. Those who cherish what is best in the
old life will make all the better members of the new.
Such trouble as we have had with our immigrants, in regard
to assimilation, is almost negligible, compared with
the complete failure of harsher methods in Europe.</p>

<p class='c010'>The larger discussion involves a struggle for survival
among innumerable ideas, springing from the innumerable
diversities of person, class, and situation. One
naturally inquires what causes some of these ideas to
survive and prevail rather than others. What makes
the success or failure of a principle or a project?</p>

<p class='c013'>Some writers will answer this question for us by pointing
to specific factors which they think are decisive—though
they by no means agree as to what these are—but
I take it that the determining agent is nothing less than
the total situation, which we must grasp as a whole in
order to see the trend of things. The life of an idea depends
upon the degree and manner of its working in the
actual complex state of the mind of the people, consisting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>largely of impulses, habits, and traditions whose
sources are remote and obscure. Take, for example, the
change in our ideas regarding the functions and problems
of women, indicated by the contrast between the literature
of the nineteenth century and that of to-day. Certain
reasons can be given for it, such as the growing self-dependence
and class-consciousness of women, their employment
in modern industry and the popularization of social
and biological science. These and many other elements
are worked up by discussion, producing an atmosphere
in which the conventions of fifty years ago seem prudish
and absurd. A novel, a play, or a social programme will
succeed now which our fathers and mothers would have
suppressed.</p>

<p class='c013'>I doubt whether rules can be formulated which will help
us much in interpreting the state of the social mind and
predicting what success a given proposition will have.
The attempts which have been made in this direction,
such as those of Tarde in his <i><span lang="fr">Logique sociale</span></i>, seem to me
mechanical and unilluminating. If we accept the view
that the higher intelligence is a complex imaginative
synthesis, there is little reason for expecting help from
such rules. What is necessary is that the interpreter and
prophet shall have the knowledge and vision to reproduce
in himself the essential influences of the time, and so, by
a dramatic process, carry on the movement in his imagination
and foresee the outcome. No formula of psychological
selection will be of much use. Life is not subject to
such formulas.</p>

<p class='c010'>If an idea is quite incapable of working in the actual
situation, if there is no soil in which it can grow, people
will take no interest in it, it will not “take hold” anywhere,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>but come and go as a mere flitting impression, not
even achieving definite statement. It is certain that ideas
not infrequently occur to men which will later be esteemed
as great truths, but are rejected by those to whom they
occur because they do not kindle in the actual trend of
thought. This was the case with the Darwinian idea of
development through the survival of the fittest; several
persons who are known, and probably others who are not
known, having seen it vaguely long before Darwin, and
it came to power only when the situation was ripe.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is particularly true of social and moral ideals,
since these are never novel or obscure in themselves, but
are old thoughts renewed and illuminated from time to
time by successive waves of faith. The Christian conception
of a society of brothers with God as a loving father,
is probably older than civilization, and can never have
been far from men’s desires. The case is much the same
with the idea of democracy, with Rousseau’s idea of the
nobility of human nature and the depravity of institutions,
and with Kant’s moral imperative.</p>

<p class='c013'>Even if an idea impresses an individual here and there
it can hardly hold its ground without some kind of group
support. Thus Hamerton says of the development of
ideas in art: “The taste and knowledge of their contemporaries
usually erect impassable barriers around artists.
If there is no feeling or desire for a certain order of truth
on the part of the public, the artist will have no stimulus
to study that order of truth; nay, if he does study and render
it, he will incur insult and abuse, and be thereby
driven back into the line of subject and treatment which
his contemporaries understand.”<a id='r77'></a><a href='#f77' class='c014'><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>However, an idea that gets possession of even one individual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>so that he will formulate and defend it cannot
be said to have failed. It takes its part in the larger
discussion, and, however contumeliously rejected, it will
leave some impress upon the ideas that are accepted.
And the stone that the builders reject may prove to be
the cornerstone of to-morrow’s edifice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Educated men are often alarmed by the spread of superficial
doctrines which have a timely appeal to passion or
interest, and seem likely to sweep the people off their feet
and into disaster. It is normal in the history of the United
States, or of any country where there is some freedom of
speech, that there should be a numerous party of radicals
advocating some social or economic heresy like populism,
free silver, revolutionary socialism, anarchism, or the like.
And indeed we sometimes narrowly escape being swamped
by these waves of unreason.</p>

<p class='c013'>But if the doctrine is really superficial it is likely to
prove transient. As time goes on people have opportunity
to experiment with it, usually on a small scale,
and if they are fairly intelligent and their social condition
not desperately bad this gives rise to a sounder judgment.
In the meantime the particular situation which
gave impetus to the doctrine is likely to have changed,
as the free-silver agitation, for example, was undermined
by the increased production of gold and the advent of
higher prices.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another way by which unwise propositions tend to be
eliminated is what may be called cancellation. The multitude
of frothy schemes that secure a following might
well discourage us did we not reflect that they are as antagonistic
to one another as they are to good sense, so
that the net resultant may be zero. If we have, on the
one hand, extreme anarchists who would break down all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>discipline, we have, on the other, collectivists who would
take away all freedom. It is in the very nature of error
to lack adaptability to the rest of life, so that it cannot
well form large wholes. The saying that no combination
of wise men could resist a combination of all the fools
does not show much insight at the best, and may be answered
by saying that those who combine effectively
cannot be fools, since they are meeting one of the most
exacting tests of intelligence.</p>

<p class='c010'>We cannot assert, however, that harmful ideas are
necessarily eliminated and that only the beneficial survive.
All that we can say with confidence in this direction
is that social organisms are subject to a struggle,
and in order to survive have to exhibit a certain measure
of efficiency, or power to meet the struggle. If they have
a long life it shows that ideas and practices injurious with
reference to the struggle have been kept within limits.
If we go beyond this and assert an onward and upward
tendency in life we must, I think, rely finally upon faith
rather than demonstration to support our belief.</p>

<p class='c013'>Much that has shown a vigorous power of survival all
through history we believe to be harmful, as, for example,
drink, prostitution, and many forms of superstition.
Scarcely anything has swept over the world more triumphantly
than the tobacco habit, which, to say the least,
is under suspicion. Professor Keller reminds us that there
are such things as harmful <em>mores</em>, and he instances a number
of customs relating to marriage that are clearly of
this kind.<a id='r78'></a><a href='#f78' class='c014'><sup>[78]</sup></a> The scruples of the people of India about
killing poisonous snakes result in an immense increase of
these animals, and of human deaths. Many of the ancient
beliefs surviving in backward parts of our own country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>regarding the sowing of crops only when the “sign of
the moon” is favorable, and the like, are of a similar
nature.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fact that extremes of riches and poverty, subjection
of women and domination of one class over another
have existed throughout history is no proof that such
conditions are innocuous, but merely that they have not
been so destructive as to prevent survival. And, in general,
we may say of the social system that comes down
to us from the past that, while as a whole and in its
longer tested parts it has proved capable of life, we have
no reason to think that this life is of the highest kind practicable.</p>

<p class='c010'>In a time of rapid change the struggle of ideas becomes
both more intense and more confused. The social whole
is in somewhat the position of a man who has been thrown
out of his old occupation and is trying to establish himself
in a new one: many questions press upon him at once,
while the rules and habits he has been used to go by do
not suit the changed conditions. In a more settled time
there are traditional beliefs which serve as accepted standards
of judgment—as the Scriptures or the writings of
the Fathers have served in the history of the church.
But in our own period—though we are no doubt too much
in it to judge truly of its character—it seems that hardly
any authority remains, that we have to create the law
as well as make decisions under it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The effort of intelligence to find a rational course in
such a time results in a somewhat anarchic conflict of
diverse interpretations. Extreme views of many sorts
are urged, and there is no accredited arbiter to decide
among them.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the midst of this the ordinary individual, who has
no taste for complex thought but longs only for peace
with honor, is often in a sad condition. He is like the
little neutral country caught up into the struggle of contending
Powers and overrun by all of them, unable to
stand alone or to find a sure support.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the more deeply the ground is rent the more fundamental
are the truths revealed. A conflict that destroys
accepted principles almost certainly brings to light
others that are more general and permanent, because after
all life is rational, it seems, and the social mind, when
pushed to it, has usually been able to discover as much
of this rationality as it really needed. As regards religious
belief we can already see that ideas of a scope and depth
that few could have attained fifty years ago are now
becoming domesticated in every-day thought. The conflict
in this field has resulted in the perception that none
of the contending creeds and forms is essential, but that
the permanently human and divine reality, not confined
in any formulation, creates new expression for itself along
with the general growth of life.</p>

<p class='c013'>Indeed it would seem that the struggles of the age have
given us at least one principle which change cannot easily
overthrow; the principle, namely, that life itself is a
process rather than a state; so that we no longer expect
anything final, but look to discover in the movement
itself sufficient matter for reason and faith.</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'>PUBLIC OPINION AN ORGANIC PROCESS RATHER THAN A CONSENSUS—DECISION—THE
SIGNIFICANCE OF MINORITIES</p>

<p class='c010'>Public opinion, if we wish to see it as it is, should be
regarded as an organic process, and not merely as a state
of agreement about some question of the day. It is, in
truth, a complex growth, always continuous with the past,
never becoming simple, and only partly unified from time
to time for the sake of definite action. Like other phases
of intelligence, it is of the nature of a drama, many characters
taking part in a variegated unity of action. The
leaders of the day, not only in politics but in every field,
the class groups—capitalists, socialists, organized labor,
professional men, farmers and the like—the various types
of radicals and reactionaries; all these are members of an
intricate, progressing whole. And it is a whole for the
same reason that a play is, because the characters, though
divergent and often conflicting, interact upon one another
and create a total movement which the mind must follow
by a total process. For practical uses as well as for adequate
thinking this conception is better than the idea of
public opinion as agreement. It aims to see the real
thing, the developing thought of men, in its genesis and
tendencies, and with a view to its probable operation.</p>

<p class='c013'>The view that we have no public opinion except when,
and in so far as, people agree, is a remnant of that obsolete
social philosophy which regarded individuals as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>normally isolated, and social life as due to their emerging
partly from this isolation and coming together in certain
specific ways. It is this habit of thought, apparently,
that makes it difficult for most persons to understand that
a group which has maturely thought over and discussed a
matter arrives at a public opinion regarding it whether
the members agree or not. That is, the mental process
has developed about the matter in question and there has
come to be a unity of action, as in a play, which insures
that, however opinions may differ, they make parts of a
whole, each having helped to form all the others. No
one would deny unity of action to Macbeth because the
characters are various and conflicting; if they were not,
the unity would be too mechanical to be of interest; and
so would it be with opinion if it attained any such uniformity
as is sometimes supposed.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is true that a process of opinion can hardly exist
without a certain underlying like-mindedness, sufficient
for mutual understanding and influence, among the members
of the group; if they are separated into uncommunicating
sections the unity of action is lost. Race difference
may do this (largely, perhaps, by making men think they
are more unlike than they are), religious division has done
it, also traditional hostility, as where one nation has subjugated
another, and even social caste. But communicated
differences are the life of opinion, as cross-breeding
is of a natural stock.</p>

<p class='c010'>The main argument for basing the idea of public opinion
upon agreement is that this is the only method of
decision and consequently of action; which is what all
is for; in other words, that it is only as agreement that
opinion can function.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>It is true that decision is a phase of the utmost importance,
corresponding to choice in the individual, and that
the whole process of attention, discussion, and democratic
organization is, in a sense, a preparation for it. It is
equally true, however, that it is only a partial and often
a superficial act, involving compromise and adjusted to a
particular contingency. A real understanding of the
human mind, both in its individual and public aspects,
requires that it be seen in the whole process, of which
majorities and decisions are but transient phases. The
choice of to-day is important; but the inchoate conditions
which are breeding the choices to come are at least equally
so. We shall be interested to find whether Democrats or
Republicans win the next election; but how much more
interesting it would be to know what obscure group of
non-conformers is cherishing the idea that will prevail
twenty years from now.</p>

<p class='c010'>The organic view seems to be the only one that does
justice to the significance of minorities. If you think of
agreement as the essential thing they appear as mere
remnants, refractory and irreconcilable factions of no
great importance. But if you have an eye for organic
development, it is obvious that minorities, even small
ones, may be the most pregnant factors in the situation.
All progress, all notable change of any kind, begins with
a few, and it is, accordingly, among the small and beginning
parties that we may always look for the tendencies
that are likely to dominate the future. Originality,
faith, and the resolution to make things better are always
in a minority, while every majority is made up for the
most part of inert and dependent elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is a fact of the utmost significance when a few, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>even a single individual, are so convinced of something
that they are willing to stand up for it in the midst of a
hostile majority; their very isolation insuring that they
have more convincing grounds for their action than the
ordinary undecided and conforming citizen. So Liebknecht,
who alone in the German Reichstag opposed and
denounced the war, was perhaps of more significance than
all the more docile mass of the Socialist party. All great
movements have in their early history heroes and often
martyrs who were the seed of their future success.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is nothing more democratic than intelligent and
devoted non-conformity, because it means that the individual
is giving his freedom and courage to the service of
the whole. Subservience, to majorities, as to any other
authority, tends to make vigorous democracy impossible.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXII<br> <span class='c011'>RATIONAL CONTROL THROUGH STANDARDS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>WHAT IS RATIONAL CONTROL?—STANDARDS AS TESTS OF FUNCTION—MINIMUM
STANDARDS—MECHANICAL TREND OF STANDARDIZATION—HIGHER
FUNCTIONS NOT NUMERICALLY MEASURABLE—THE
JUDGMENT OF EXPERT GROUPS—NEED OF STANDARD-SETTING
GROUPS—UNIVERSITIES AS STANDARD-MAKERS—THE CRITIC</p>

<p class='c010'>The ideal aim of intelligence seems to be the rational
control of human life. Just what do we mean by this?
Surely not that a conscious process must everywhere be
substituted for an unconscious; common sense tells us that
this is impracticable or inexpedient. Perhaps a fair statement
would be that we mean by rational control a conduct
of affairs such that their working, in a large way,
commends itself to intelligence, even though not always
guided by it.</p>

<p class='c013'>A man’s every-day life runs, for the most part, on instinct
and habit. His digestion and other physiological
functions, his routine work and recreation, go on without
much help from his thinking. Rational control consists
mainly in a certain watchfulness over these processes,
which awakes attention when anything goes wrong with
them, and applies an intelligent remedy if it can. It is
quite as likely to be manifested by judicious inactivity as
by interference. So with the manager of a factory: the
secret of effective control, in his case, is to allow every
machine and every subordinate to do his own work,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>paying, for the most part, no attention to the details,
and yet carrying in his mind an ideal of the working of
the whole which enables him to see and correct anything
that goes wrong. Likewise with the social organization
at large. Its working consists, in great preponderance,
of ideas, feelings, actions that have no conscious reference
to the system as a whole, but are, from that point
of view, merely mechanical; while rational control calls
for an intelligence and idealism that understands how the
whole ought to work, and exerts the necessary authority
at the right time and place.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is a certain presumption in favor of letting
the unconscious processes alone. They are the outcome
of a tentative development, confused and blind for the
most part, but resulting in something that does, after a
fashion, work; and this is no mean achievement. One of
the best fruits of our study of history is to perceive how
little we know, and how possible it is that what appears to
us senseless and harmful does serve some useful purpose.
A conservatism like that of Burke is always worth considering,
whose later writings, as every one knows, are
largely an endeavor to make us conscious of the limits of
consciousness, in order that we may conserve the benefits
that we owe to unconscious growth. The traditional
organisms of society—language, folkways, common law
and the like—exhibit on the whole an adaptability to
conditions, a workableness, that could not be equalled
by reflective consciousness alone. The latter may give
us Volapük, but from the former we have the English of
Shakespeare.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nevertheless there is an evident need of a competent
intelligence to watch and supplement the unconscious
processes. George Meredith compares the irregular and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>uncertain progress of the world to that of a drunkard
staggering toward home,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Still that way bent albeit his legs are slack.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>No doubt it does get on, after a fashion, but the fashion
is often one that is disgraceful to a rational being. While
there is a great deal of truth in the idea of the involuntary
beneficence of economic competition, it is certain
that under the too great sway of this idea natural resources
are wasted, children stunted and deprived of opportunity,
women exploited, and the unrighteous allowed to thrive.</p>

<p class='c010'>If we consider how rational control may be achieved
we are led at once into the question of standards of service.
If we could devise and apply, in connection with
every function, some sound test of performance, so that
all concerned might know just what good service is, and
how the service of one agent compares with that of
another, the question of control would become simple.</p>

<p class='c013'>This would not only act directly to promote efficiency
of every sort through selecting the best men and methods,
and holding them to a high grade of work, but would
have an immeasurably beneficent effect in diffusing
through the community order, contentment, clearness of
purpose, and good-will, instead of the confusion, unrest,
and hostility that now so largely prevail. Standards of
any kind, if generally accepted, have the same kind of
effect that the use of money has in economic exchanges:
they make relations definite and thus facilitate co-operation
and allay disputes. Ill-feeling, whether toward
other persons or toward life in general, is based chiefly,
perhaps, on resentments and perplexities arising from the
lack of settled valuations. If we all knew what our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>place in life was and what our just claims were, as compared
with those of others, the confusion that now prevails
would subside.</p>

<p class='c010'>We may distinguish, as regards human conduct, two
sorts of standards: the higher or emulative, instigating us
to attain or approach an ideal, and minimum standards
or limits of toleration, conformity to which is more or less
compulsory. The former appeal to the more capable and
ambitious, the latter are imposed on the backward. One
defines the type at the bottom, the other at the top.</p>

<p class='c013'>In almost every kind of activity it is harmful to
tolerate those who fall below a certain level of achievement:
they not only set a bad example and lower the
grade of service, but impair co-operation and <em>esprit de
corps</em>. Even in competitive games, such as foot-racing,
jumping, golf, and the like, it is usual to classify the players
so that those in each group shall be sufficiently homogeneous
to incite one another to do their best; and every
one knows how detrimental is the influence of a player
of a lower class. In the breeding of animals we have the
immemorial practice of eliminating individuals who lack
certain “points,” and the social science of eugenics aims,
in a similar manner, to set a standard of propagation for
the human race. Our whole body of penal law is a system
of minimum requirements as to conduct, and the
conventions or <em>mores</em> enforced by public sentiment have
much the same character.</p>

<p class='c013'>The idea is ancient and familiar, its present interest
arising largely from a tendency to apply it more and more
stringently in the control of economic competition. It
appears here in a great variety of forms, but the general
aim is to classify more definitely the kinds of economic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>struggle, to determine who are and who are not legitimate
participants in each, and to see to it that all are carried
on under proper rules for the protection of the weak and
the welfare of the public.</p>

<p class='c013'>All competent students feel that there is urgent need
of a rational programme for the protection from crushing
and degradation of those who, for whatever reason, are
not in a position to protect themselves. If their weakness
is intrinsic they need to be removed from the general
struggle and put in a class by themselves; if it is accidental
they require intelligent succor while they are recovering
their strength.</p>

<p class='c010'>The weak side of the standardization idea, as applied
to society, is its trend toward the numerical and mechanical.
An external, visible test, almost always superficial
in this sphere, is easy to apply, and for that reason
recommends itself to all who seek precise results without
an exercise of the higher faculties of the mind. This,
added to the prestige which numerical methods have
gained by their value to physical science, has given rise
to a formalism which intrudes them where they do not
belong, and inspires a confidence in results often in inverse
ratio to their value.</p>

<p class='c013'>To the statistical type of mind precision is apt to seem
in itself a guaranty of truth, and it is common to see
elaborate calculations based on assumptions which will
not bear scrutiny. The authors of such structures instinctively
avoid any kind of thinking except mathematical.
This was partly the case with Francis Galton, a
man of real eminence, who made a statistical study of
men of genius, in which the numerical part is logically
dependent upon the postulate that practically all men of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>genius become famous.<a id='r81'></a><a href='#f81' class='c014'><sup>[81]</sup></a> This view he does not examine
adequately; the bent of his mind unfitted him to do so.
He had to have a standard test of genius in order to open
the way for statistical treatment; and he easily convinced
himself that fame was such a test. His postulate, however,
is pretty clearly false, and his calculations, consequently,
of doubtful value.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many accept numerical system and precision as “science”
without further inquiry. I have seen a university
faculty adopt without question a resolution recommending
as scientific the distribution of examination marks
according to the statistical curve of chance variations
from a mean, when probably few if any of those present
had asked themselves whether it was likely, in common
sense, that the performances of the students followed any
such law.</p>

<p class='c013'>Numerical tests may, no doubt, be used to compare
the results of processes which are in themselves nonmechanical
and perhaps inscrutable. Thus of two salesmen
spending the same time on similar routes selling the
same goods at the same prices, one will sell twice as many
as the other; it is often impossible to say why. “Personality”
does it; that is, a complex of influences beyond
the sphere of precise analysis. But you can measure the
results of its operation and be fairly sure they will be repeated.
It is the same with authors. When a new writer
submits the manuscript of a novel the publisher can make
only a very uncertain guess as to how many copies of it
will sell; but when several novels have been published
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>and shown their power to interest the public a reasonably
safe prediction is possible. The statistical method does
not require that the process we are testing be understood,
but only that it be uniform. In that case its future working
may be predicted from its past. There is a large and
legitimate field for ingenuity in thus standardizing human
function.</p>

<p class='c013'>Formalism is apt to come in, however, by our taking a
mechanical view of the function itself, of the end to be
sought, in order to make it more easily measurable. This
objection may be made, for example, to rating and rewarding
salesmen according to the amount of their sales.
It seems that this is not, in practice, a good plan, because
their behavior counts in many ways not covered by such
a calculation. A merchant says: “If you have five hundred
sales-people working on a straight commission basis,
you have five hundred individuals who are, in principle,
each one in business for himself.... This means that
there is no group spirit, no sense of unity in the organization,
no co-operative spirit present. It works out very
badly.” He suggests a modified test, also numerical,
which is inadequate in theory, however it may work.
The complete function of personality is never measurable.
We have the same fallacy in the attempts to measure
the value of a professor by the number of students electing
his courses, or the number of hours he spends in his
classroom.</p>

<p class='c010'>It seems to be a general truth that the higher a social
or mental function the less capable it is of numerical
measurement; the reason being that the higher functions
are acts of creative organization that can be appreciated
only by a judgment of the same order. The work of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>lawyer, a teacher, a clergyman, a man of science, even of
an artistic craftsman, can be measured only by expert
opinion. Our tests of the mental capacity of children
should be mechanical only in so far as they relate to mechanical
processes, like verbal memory or calculation.
When it comes to higher capacities, like the understanding
of complex ideas or sentiments, such as honor, the test,
if it is to be of any value, must be applied, not mechanically,
but by some one of imagination to understand what
the child means by his answers.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have little confidence in the more ambitious projects
of some psychologists in the way of measuring <em>a priori</em> the
capacity of the mind for the various vocations. I do not
doubt that many useful hints can be gained by laboratory
methods; but if a function is essentially social the test
should also be social: science should keep as close to nature
as possible. In civil service examinations such qualifications
as speed in typewriting may be ascertained by a
mechanical test, but as regards any sort of social ability,
such as fitness for collecting labor statistics, or conducting
correspondence, the main reliance is necessarily placed on
success in actual work of a similar character.</p>

<p class='c013'>In short, any merely mechanical test of the higher
human faculties and achievements is, and must remain,
an illusion. The only real criterion is the sympathetic
and, as it were, participating judgment of a mind qualified
by capacity and training to understand these faculties
and share in their operation. Goethe maintained that the
only competent critic of literary work is the man who can
do similar work himself, and the principle is of wide
application.</p>

<p class='c010'>Is there, then, any way of testing the higher functions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>involving leadership and creative organization,
so as to maintain a high level of performance? There
is no way that is precise or final, especially where originality
is in question—since it is the nature of originality
to set aside accepted tests—but higher functions of a
somewhat settled character may be kept up to the mark
through the judgments of an expert group. The various
branches of natural science—say, astronomy, geology,
or physiology—offer good examples, in that each possesses
a group of men with high and definite ideals as
to what is standard achievement in their specialty, and
with a disposition to apply these in exalting the worthy
and casting the unworthy out. It is much the same in
all the so-called learned professions. The principle applies
also, though with a somewhat looser discipline, in
literature, sculpture, painting, architecture, and music;
that is, achievement in each of these is appraised, more or
less decisively, by a competent special group.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such groups may act quite definitely. They may form
associations and appoint judges—let us say to accept or
reject paintings for an exposition, or to select among competing
plans for a public building. The judges, if they are
competent, do not decide wholly according to old models
or traditions. They are men trained by active participation
in the artistic endeavors of the time, and they aim,
by an effort of creative appreciation, to understand what
new achievement an artist has sought, and the measure
of his success.</p>

<p class='c013'>In spheres like patriotism, philanthropy, and religion,
the standards are embodied in the lives and works of men
whom the appreciative imaginations of a kindred group
recognize as bearers of the ideal. For the Christian tradition
the “glorious company of the apostles, the noble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>army of martyrs,” and their successors incarnate the
ideals of the group in cherished examples.</p>

<p class='c010'>In this regard society greatly needs a more various and
closely knit group organization. The modern enlargement
of relations has in part broken down the old groups,
based chiefly on locality, family, and class, and brought
in a somewhat formless and unchannelled state of things
for which a remedy must apparently be sought in the
development of groups of a new kind. Only close and
lasting co-operation can discipline the individual and
provide standards for every kind of function.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is peculiarly requisite to have vigorous and distinctive
groups devoted to achievement for which there is no
commercial reward. We need men who will passionately
set themselves to do fine and ever finer work, hungry for
perfection, careless of popular recognition, inspired by
congenial example and appreciation, and creating higher
standards for those who follow.</p>

<p class='c013'>The action of commercialism in repressing higher
achievement is quite simple: it merely sets up such a din
that it is hard to hear anything else. It is ever assailing
us from newspapers and from the voices, eyes, and actions
of our associates. If we have no momentum of our own
it carries us along. It is scarcely possible for one to make
separate headway against it: we must have groups and
environments, organized to other ends, in which we may
take refuge.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is a frequent remark that it is the function of the
universities to set the standards of modern democracy.
I suppose the idea of this is that since we have abandoned
the standard-setting leadership of a hereditary class we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>must look for a substitute to groups trained and inspired
by the educational institutions. This implies a noble
conception of such institutions, and the more one thinks
of it the more reasonable it appears. It would mean that
the universities should select and train competent men in
all the more intellectual functions, including literature and
the fine arts, inspiring them with ideals which, as members
of special groups, they would uphold and effectuate for
the good of society. Beyond this, it should mean for all
students a moral culture and spirit of devotion to their
country and to humanity fit to set the standards of the
nation in these high regards. I do not think that such
supreme leadership or standard-setting can come from
any one source, but the universities, as the appointed
organs of higher culture, may aspire to take a large part
in it. To their actual achievement only moderate praise
can be given.</p>

<p class='c013'>When I am raking and burning leaves, as I have to in
the fall and spring, I often light one little pile, and, when
it is well afire, I pick from it a burning leaf or two on my
rake and carry them to the next pile, which thus catches
their flame. It seems to me that this is what a university
should do for the higher life of our people. It should
be on fire, and each student who goes out should be a
burning leaf to start the flame in the community where
he goes.</p>

<p class='c010'>The working out of higher control turns much upon the
critic, whose function is no less than to incarnate intelligence,
to embrace in his mind the whole organism and
process, and to evaluate the operation of every part. In
literature and art the competent critic—Goethe, let us
say, or Sainte-Beuve—aims to appreciate each man’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>work as a function of the universal spirit and declare its
part in the whole. The same principle applies to more
special groups. In the army the critic is the consummate
officer who, in times of peace, observes carefully the tests
and evolutions and brings to bear upon every detail an
expert judgment of its significance with reference to that
success in war which is his supreme ideal. In industry,
considered as production, he is the efficiency expert.
Considering it from the standpoint of human welfare he
is a social expert with or without official standing.</p>

<p class='c013'>All the settled and interesting lines of human achievement
naturally produce critics, because contemplative
men, familiar with the tradition, find enjoyment in surveying
the field as a whole, and appraising the various
contributions. The matter is bound up with organization,
and where that is lacking criticism is usually weak.
For this reason, largely, American culture is sadly deficient
in it.</p>

<p class='c013'>We urgently need a criticism of our social system that
shall be competent to a somewhat authoritative estimate
of the human value of the various activities. In order
to this it must be well instructed in social science and history,
familiar also with practical conditions, courageous,
judicious, and highly gifted by nature with insight and
faith. We have not attained this as yet; our judgments,
like the conditions themselves, are in much confusion.
It is fairly apparent, however, that social criticism is
growing with the growth of research and endeavor. Although
social workers are ardent people, often with a
good deal of bias, yet their serious struggle with real conditions,
preceded, commonly, by academic training, has
already enabled them to illumine many obscure matters
and put public sentiment in right tracks. And the more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>retired students who deal with social psychology, philosophy,
and statistics are no doubt doing their part also.
There is a decline in that particularistic spirit that spent
itself in the advocacy of conflicting panaceas, and a growth
in the larger spirit which judges all schemes with reference
to a common organic ideal.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>DRAMATIC CHARACTER OF THE SCIENCES OF LIFE—SPECIAL CHARACTER
OF SOCIOLOGY—NUMERICAL EXACTNESS NOT ITS IDEAL—QUALIFICATIONS
OF A SOCIOLOGIST—PRACTICAL VALUE OF SOCIOLOGY</p>

<p class='c010'>We have seen that social intelligence is essentially an
imaginative grasp of the process going on about us,
enabling us to carry this forward into the future and anticipate
how it will work. It is a dramatic vision by which
we see how the agents now operating must interact upon
one another and issue in a new situation. How shall we
apply this idea to social science? Shall we say that that
too is dramatic?</p>

<p class='c013'>There would be nothing absurd in such a view. All
science may be said to work by a dramatic method when
it takes the results of minute observation and tries to
build them into fresh wholes of knowledge. This, we
know, takes creative imagination; the intelligence must
act in sympathy with nature and foresee its operation.
The work on the evolution of life for which Darwin is
most famous may justly be described as an attempt to
dramatize what mankind had come to know about plants
and animals. He took the painfully won details and
showed how they contributed to a living process whose
operation could be traced in the past, and possibly anticipated
for the future. And, indeed, so homogeneous is
life, the phases he found in this process—divergence,
struggle, adaptation—are much the same as have always
been recognized in the drama.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>Darwin regarded the study of fossils as a means to the
better understanding of life upon earth, as a way to <em>see
what is going on</em>, and in like manner the precise observation
of individuals and families in sociology is preparatory
to a social synthesis whose aim also is to see what
is going on.</p>

<p class='c013'>The routine conception of science as <em>merely</em> precise
study of details is never a sound one, and is particularly
barren in the social field. If we are to arrive at principles
or have any success at all in prediction we must keep
the imagination constantly at work. And even in detailed
studies we must dramatize more or less to make
the facts intelligible. An investigator of juvenile delinquency
who was not armed with insight as well as
schedules would not report anything of much value.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are marked differences, however, between biology
and sociology, considered as studies of process, of
which I will note especially two. One is that in biology
essential change in types is chiefly slow and not easily
perceptible. For the most part we have to do with a
moving equilibrium of species and modes of life repeating
itself generation after generation. It took a Darwin
to show, by comparing remote periods, that nature was
really evolving, dramatic, creative.</p>

<p class='c013'>In social life, on the other hand, change is obvious and
urgent; so that the main practical object of our science is
to understand and control it. The dramatic element,
which in biology is revealed only to a titanic imagination,
becomes the most familiar and intimate thing in experience.
Any real study of society must be first, last, and
nearly all the time a study of process.</p>

<p class='c013'>Again, the sciences that deal with social life are unique
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>in that we who study them are a conscious part of the
process. We can know it by sympathetic participation,
in a manner impossible in the study of plant or animal
life. Many indeed find this fact embarrassing, and are
inclined to escape it by trying to use only “objective”
methods, or to question whether it does not shut out
sociology and introspective psychology from the number
of true sciences.</p>

<p class='c013'>I should say that it puts these studies in a class by themselves:
whether you call them sciences or something else
is of no great importance. It is their unique privilege
to approach life from the point of view of conscious and
familiar partaking of it. This involves unique methods
which must be worked out independently. The sooner
we cease circumscribing and testing ourselves by the canons
of physical and physiological science the better. Whatever
we do that is worth while will be done by discarding
alien formulas and falling back upon our natural bent to
observation and reflection. Going ahead resolutely with
these we shall work out methods as we go. In fact sociology
has already developed at least one original method
of the highest promise, namely that of systematic social
surveys.</p>

<p class='c013'>The reason that students of the principles of sociology
(as distinguished from those whose aim is immediately
practical) are somewhat less preoccupied with the digging
out of primary facts than with their interpretation, is
simply that, for the present, the latter is the more difficult
task. We have within easy reach facts which, if
fully digested and correlated, would probably be ample
to illuminate the whole subject. It is very much as in
political economy, whose principles have been worked
out mainly by the closer and closer study and interpretation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>of facts which, as details, every business man
knows.</p>

<p class='c013'>Knowledge requires both observation and interpretation,
neither being more scientific than the other. And
each branch of science must be worked out in its own way,
which is mainly to be found in the actual search for truth
rather than by <em>a priori</em> methodology. Sociology has as
ample a field of verifiable fact as any subject, and it is
not clear that the interpretations are more unsettled
than they are elsewhere. The chief reason why it
has developed late and still appears uninviting to many
is the very abundance and apparent confusion of the
material, which seems to take away the hope of simple,
sure, and lasting results. One purpose in our study of
principles is to restore this hope and give order to this
abundance. And while there are certainly special difficulties,
as in all sciences, our own is coming to afford, I
think, as great intellectual attraction as can be found in
other studies, along with a human and social character
peculiar to itself. It will be strange if an increasing proportion
of good minds do not give themselves to it.</p>

<p class='c010'>While I ascribe the utmost importance to precision in
preparing the data for social science, I do not think its
true aim is to bring society within the sphere of arithmetic.
Exact prediction and mechanical control for the
social world I believe to be a false ideal inconsiderately
borrowed from the provinces of physical science. There
is no real reason to think that this sort of prediction or
control will ever be possible.</p>

<p class='c013'>Much has been made of the fact that human phenomena,
when studied statistically on a large scale, often show a
marked numerical uniformity from year to year; and some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>have even inferred that human spontaneity is an illusion,
and that we are really controlled by mathematical laws
as precise as those which guide the course of the planets.
But I take it that such uniformities as are to be observed
in births, marriages, suicides, and many other human
phenomena do not indicate underlying principles analogous
to the laws of gravitation or chemical reaction.
They merely show that under a given social condition the
number of persons who will choose to perform certain
definite acts within the year may remain almost the same,
or may be increased or diminished by certain definite
changes, such as the advent of war or economic hardship.
They no more prove that human conduct is subject to
numerical law than does the fact that I eat three meals a
day, or that I shall spend more money if my salary is
raised, and less if it is diminished.</p>

<p class='c013'>In other words statistical uniformities do not show that
it is possible to predict numerically the working of intelligence
<em>in new situations</em>, and of course that is the decisive
test. Where exact prediction is possible the whole basis
of it I take to be the fact that the general social situation
remains the same, or is changed in ways which do not
involve new problems of choice in the field studied. In
short, the more the question is one of intelligence the less
the numerical method can cope with it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Uniformity in the suicide rate, so far as it exists, shows
that the causes of suicide, whatever they may be, are operating
in about the same degree from year to year, that
the social situation is static, or rather in moving equilibrium.
It reveals no law of suicide beyond the fact that
it is connected in some definite way with the social situation
in general. It does not help you to understand why
Saul Jones killed himself, or to predict whether Jonathan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>Smith will or not. All you know is that if the general
current of human trouble goes on about the same, the
number of cases is not likely to vary much.</p>

<p class='c013'>Serious attempts to understand suicide and to predict
its prevalence under various conditions are based, if they
are intelligent, upon psychological theories of an imaginative
character. Thus Dürkheim, in his book upon the
subject, develops the idea of “altruistic” suicide, and enables
us to understand how a disgraced army officer, for
example, might be driven to it by social pressure. To
such studies statistics is only an adjunct.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the case of marriage you may be able to predict
with some accuracy the effect of the simpler sort of economic
changes, such as larger or smaller crops, but, if
so, it is because marriage is a familiar problem, settled
in much the same way by one generation after the other,
on the basis of lasting instincts or conventions. You
cannot, in the same way, anticipate the outcome of the
next presidential campaign, or of any other transaction
in which the human mind is confronting a fresh situation.</p>

<p class='c013'>The only instrument that can in any degree meet the
test of prediction, where new problems of higher choice
confront the mind, is the instructed imagination, which,
by a kind of inspired intelligence, may anticipate within
itself the drama of social process, and so foresee the issue.
That this supreme act of the mind, never more than partly
successful, even in the simplest questions, can ever become,
on a large scale, sure, precise, and demonstrable
before the event, there is no evidence or probability. So
far as we can now see or infer, social prediction, in the
higher provinces, must ever remain tentative, and I suspect
that all the sciences which deal with the life process
are subject to a similar limitation. Darwin’s suggestion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>regarding the “free will” of the dinosaur would seem to
indicate that this was his opinion.<a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c014'><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Intelligent social prediction is contradictory to determinism,
because, instead of ignoring the creative will, it
accepts it and endeavors by sympathy to enter into it
and foresee its working. If I predict an artistic or humanitarian
movement, it is partly because I feel as if I
myself, with whatever freedom and creative power is in
me, would choose to share in such a movement.</p>

<p class='c013'>The possibility of social science rests upon the hypothesis
that social life is in some sense rational and sequent.
It has been assumed that this can be true only if it is
mechanically calculable. But there may easily be another
sort of rationality and sequence, not mechanical,
consistent with a kind of freedom, which makes possible
an organized development of social knowledge answering
to the organic character of the social process. The life
of men has a unity and order of its own, which may or
may not prove to be the same in essence as that which
rules the stars. It seems to include a creative element
which must be grasped by the participating activity of
the mind rather than by computations. How far it can
be known and predicted is a matter for trial. The right
method is the one that may be found to give the best results.
Apparently it is not, except in subordinate degree,
the numerical method.</p>

<p class='c010'>A sociologist must have the patient love of truth and
the need to reduce it to principles which all men of science
require. Besides this, however, he needs the fullest
sympathy and participation in the currents of life. He
can no more stand aloof than can the novelist or the poet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>and all his work is, in a certain sense, autobiographic. I
mean that it is all based on perceptions which he has won
by actual living. He should know his groups as Mr.
Bryce came to know America, with a real intimacy due
to long and considerate familiarity with individuals, families,
cities, and manifold opinions and traditions. He
cannot be a specialist in the same way that a chemist or
a botanist can, because he cannot narrow his life without
narrowing his grasp of his subject. To attempt to build
up sociology as a technical tradition remote from the great
currents of literature and philosophy, would, in my opinion,
be a fatal error. It cannot avoid being difficult, but
it should be as little abstruse as possible. If it is not
human it is nothing.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have often thought that, in endowment, Goethe was
almost the ideal sociologist, and that one who added to
more common traits his comprehension, his disinterestedness
and his sense for organic unity and movement
might accomplish almost anything.</p>

<p class='c010'>The method of social improvement is likely to remain
experimental, but sociology is one of the means by which
the experimentation becomes more intelligent. I think,
for example, that any one who studies the theory of social
classes—the various kinds, the conditions of their formation
and continuance, their effect in moulding the minds
of those who belong to them, and the like—using what
has been written upon the subject to stimulate his own
observation and reflection, will find that the contemporary
situation is illumined for him and his grasp of the
trend of events enhanced.</p>

<p class='c013'>By observation and thought we work out generalizations
which help us to understand where we are and what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>is going on. These are “principles of sociology.” They
are similar in nature to principles of economics, and aid
our social insight just as these aid our insight into business
or finance. They supply no ready-made solutions
but give illumination and perspective. A good sociologist
might have poor judgment in philanthropy or social
legislation, just as a good political economist might have
poor judgment in investing his money. Yet, other things
equal, the mind trained in the theory of its subject will
surpass in practical wisdom one that is not.</p>

<p class='c013'>At bottom any science is simply a more penetrating
perception of facts, gained largely by selecting those that
are more universal and devoting intensive study to them—as
biologists are now studying the great fact of hereditary
transmission. In so far as we know these more
general facts we are the better prepared to work understandingly
in the actual complexities of life. Our study
should enable us to discern underneath the apparent confusion
of things the working of enduring principles of
human nature and social process, simplifying the movement
for us by revealing its main currents, something as
a general can follow the course of a battle better by the
aid of a map upon which the chief operations are indicated
and the distracting details left out. This will not
assure our control of life, but should enable us to devise
measures having a good chance of success. And in so
far as they fail we should be in a position to see what is
wrong and do better next time.</p>

<p class='c013'>I think, then, that the supreme aim of social science is
to perceive the drama of life more adequately than can
be done by ordinary observation. If it be objected that
this is the task of an artist—a Shakespeare, a Goethe, or
a Balzac—rather than of a scientist, I may answer that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>an undertaking so vast requires the co-operation of various
sorts of synthetic minds; artists, scientists, philosophers,
and men of action. Or I may say that the constructive
part of science is, in truth, a form of art.</p>

<p class='c013'>Indeed one of the best things to be expected from our
study is the power of looking upon the movement of
human life in a large, composed spirit, of seeing it in
something of ideal unity and beauty.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXIV<br> <span class='c011'>THE TENTATIVE CHARACTER OF PROGRESS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>PROGRESS IS NOT IDENTICAL WITH GROWTH OF INTELLIGENT CONTROL—NOR
IS IT DEMONSTRABLE—IT IS ESSENTIALLY TENTATIVE</p>

<p class='c010'>I cannot accept the view that progress is nothing
more or other than the growth of intelligent control.
No doubt this is a large part of it; an enlightened and
organized public will is, perhaps, our most urgent need;
but, after all, life is more than intelligence, and a conception
that exalts this alone is sure to prove inadequate.
Progress must be at least as many-faceted as the life we
already know. Moreover, it is one of those ideas, like
truth, beauty and right, which have an outlook upon the
infinite, and cannot, in the nature of the case, be circumscribed
by a definition.</p>

<p class='c013'>The truth is that it is often one of the requisites of
progress that we trust to the vague, the instinctive, the
emotional, rather than to what is ascertained and intellectual.
The spirit takes on form and clarity only under
the stress of experience: its newer outreachings are bound
to be somewhat obscure and inarticulate. The young
man who does not trust his vague intuitions as against
the formulated wisdom of his elders will do nothing
original.</p>

<p class='c013'>The opinion sometimes expressed that social science
should set forth a definite, tangible criterion of progress
is also, I think, based on a false conception of the matter,
derived, perhaps, from mechanical theories of evolution.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>Until man himself is a mechanism the lines of his higher
destiny can never be precisely foreseen. It is our part
to form ideals and try to realize them, and these ideals
give us a working test of progress, but there can be nothing
certain or final about them.</p>

<p class='c013'>The method of our advance is, perhaps, best indicated
by that which great individuals have used in the guidance
of their own lives. Goethe, for example, trusted to the
spontaneous motions of his spirit, studying these, however,
and preparing for and guiding their expression.
Each of his works represented one of these motions, and
he kept it by him for years to work upon when the impulse
should return. So the collective intelligence must
wait upon the motions of humanity, striving to anticipate
and further their higher working, but not presuming to
impose a formal programme upon them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The question whether, after all, the world really does
progress is not one that can be settled by an intellectual
demonstration of any kind. It is possible to prove that
mankind has gained and is gaining in material power,
in knowledge, and in the extent and diversity of social
organization; that history shows an enlarging perspective
and that the thoughts of men are, in truth, “broadened
with the process of the suns”: but it is always possible
to deny that these changes are progress. We seem to
mean by this term something additional, a judgment, in
fact, that the changes, whatever they may be, are on the
whole <em>good</em>. In other words progress, as commonly understood,
is essentially a moral category, and the question
whether it takes place or not is one of moral judgment.
Nothing of this kind is susceptible of incontrovertible
demonstration, because the moral judgment is not bound
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>by definite intellectual processes, nearly the same in all
minds, but takes in the most obscure and various impulses
of human nature.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suppose you compare the state of the first white settlers
in America, narrow and hard, physically, mentally,
and socially, with the comparatively easy and spacious
life of their descendants at the present time; or contrast
the life of a European peasant, dwelling in mediæval
ignorance and bondage, with that of the same peasant
and his family after they have emigrated to the United
States and come to a full share in its intelligence and
prosperity. It may seem clear to most people that these
changes, which are like those the world in general has
been undergoing, are for the better; but the matter is
quite debatable. The simpler lot of the pioneer and the
peasant can easily be made to appear desirable, and there
are, and no doubt always will be, those who maintain
that we are no better off than we were.</p>

<p class='c013'>Development, I should say, can be proved. That is,
history reveals, beyond question, a process of enlargement,
diversification, and organization, personal and social, that
seems vaguely analogous to the growth of plant and animal
organisms; but whether we are to write our moral
indorsement on the back of all this is another matter.
Is it better to be man or the marine animal, “resembling
the larvæ of existing Ascidians,”<a id='r83'></a><a href='#f83' class='c014'><sup>[83]</sup></a> from which he is believed
to have descended? In the end it comes down to
this: is life itself a good thing? We see it waxing and
shining all about us, and most of us are ready to pronounce
that it is good; but the pessimist can always
say: “To me it is an evil thing, and the more of it the
worse.” And there is no way of convincing him of error.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>In short, the reality of progress is a matter of faith,
not of demonstration. We find ourselves in the midst
of an onward movement of which our own spirits are a
part, and most of us are glad to be in it, and to ascribe
to it all the good we can conceive or divine. This seems
the brave thing to do, the hopeful, animating thing, the
only thing that makes life worth while, but it is an act
rather of faith than of mere intelligence.</p>

<p class='c010'>I hold, then, that progress, like human life in every
aspect, is essentially tentative, that we work it out as
we go along, and always must; that it is a process rather
than an attainment. The best is forever indefinable;
it is growth, renewal, onwardness, hope. The higher life
seems to be an upward struggle toward a good which we
can never secure, but of which we have glimpses in a
hundred forms of love and joy. In childhood, music,
poetry, in transient hours of vision, we know a fuller,
richer life of which we are a part, but which we can grasp
only in this dim and flitting way. All history is a reaching
out for, a slow, partial realization of, such perceptions.
The thing for us is to believe in the reality of this
larger life, seen or unseen, to cling to all persons and activities
that help to draw us into it, to trust that though
our individual hold upon it relax with age and be lost,
yet the great Whole, from which we are in some way inseparable,
lives on in growing splendor. <em>I</em> may perish,
but <em>We</em> are immortal.</p>

<p class='c013'>I look with wonder and reverence upon the great spirits
of the past and upon the expression of human nature in
countless forms of art and aspiration. It seems to me
that back of all this must be a greater Life, high and
glorious beyond my imagination, which is trying to work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>itself out through us. But this is in the nature of religion,
and I do not expect to impose it upon others by
argument.</p>

<p class='c013'>As regards the proximate future I see little to justify
any form of facile optimism, but conceive that, though the
world does move, it moves slowly, and seldom in just the
direction we hope. There is something rank and groping
about human life, like the growth of plants in the dark:
if you peer intently into it you can make out weird shapes,
the expression of forces as yet inchoate and obscure; but
the growth is toward the light.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXV<br> <span class='c011'>ART AND SOCIAL IDEALISM</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>ART AS JOYOUS SELF-EXPRESSION—IT DISENGAGES THE IDEAL—ENLARGES
SYMPATHY—THE KINSHIP OF ART AND DEMOCRACY—ART
AND LEISURE—DEMOCRATIC ART—ART AND SPECIALIZATION—COMMUNITY
IDEALS—THE MERGING OF SOCIAL IDEALS IN
RELIGIOUS</p>

<p class='c010'>The art ideal is one of joyous self-expression. It appeals
to the imagination because it seeks to bring in a
higher freedom by making our activity individual and
creative. There is nothing more inspiring, I think, than
the lives of brave artists; they seem the pioneers of a
better civilization. I am delighted to know that Ruysdael,
by love and devotion, put himself into his landscapes
and expressed things which others delight to find there.
Indeed, I care much less for the landscapes than for this
fact of personal self-realization: it gives me a breath of
hope and joy, and encourages me in the practice of an
art of my own.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pleasure of creative work and the sharing of this
by those who appreciate the product is in fact an almost
unlimited source of possible joy. Unlike the pleasure of
possessing things we win from others, it increases the
more we share it, taking us out of the selfish atmosphere
of every-day competition. A work of art is every man’s
friend and benefactor, and when we hear a good violinist,
or see a good play, or read a good book, we are not punished
for our pleasure by the sense of having had it at
some one else’s expense. The artist seems the divine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>man; he is free and creative, like God, and gives without
taking away.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is everywhere the nature of art to show us order and
beauty in life. It takes the confused and distracting
reality and, by omitting the irrelevant and giving life
and color to the significant, enables us to see the real as
the ideal. In every-day reality we are like ants in the
grass for the bigness of detail: in art we see the landscape.
It enlarges, supples, generalizes the mind, giving
us life in selected and simplified impressions. Thus almost
any genuine art cheers and composes the spirit.
One of Millet’s peasants, “The Sower,” for example, or
one of Thomas Hardy’s people, differs from anything of
the sort we might see more directly as a mournful song
differs from the jangle of actual grief: it “reveals man in
the repose of his unchanging characteristics,” and deepens
our sense of life. So in these noisy and unrestful times
people flock to the motion-picture shows, or buy cheap
fiction, in an eager quest of the ideal. How idle it is to
deprecate, justly or otherwise, the poor taste of the
masses, as if art were a matter of mere refinement, and
not of urgent need!</p>

<p class='c013'>Beyond this general function of disengaging the ideal,
art has, more particularly, that of defining and animating
our ideals of human progress. While the severest solitary
thought is necessary in understanding society and in
framing plans for its improvement, we must look to the
drama and the novel, also to poetry, music, painting,
sculpture and architecture, to put flesh and blood upon
these abstractions and give them a real hold on the minds
of the people. I cannot imagine any broad and rich
growth of democracy without a corresponding development
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>of popular art, and one of many indications that
our democracy is as yet immature and superficial is its
failure to achieve such a development. Our vision of our
country is loyal, no doubt, but not deep, mellow, many-colored.
The flavor of our civilization is like that of the
thin maple-sap just from the tree, not much condensed
or deposited in saccharine crystals.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again, nothing has more power than art to enlarge
human sympathy and unite the individual to his fellows.
We feel this strongly now and then, as when a multitude
rises to sing a patriotic song, but it belongs to all art
whose material is drawn from the general human life.
And it is in the nature of the higher kinds of art to draw
from this general life, where alone idealism has any secure
resting-place. So all great art makes us feel our oneness
with mankind, and the grandeur of the common lot: the
tragedy of King Lear, say, or the Book of Job, or the mediæval
churches, or the figures of Michelangelo, or the
great symphonies. It is full of noble reminiscence, and
of “touches of things human till they rise to touch the
spheres.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Beethoven said that “the purpose of music is to bring
about a oneness of emotion, and thus suggest to our minds
the coming time of a universal brotherhood,” and certainly
nothing can do more than popular art to make such
a time possible. As music can melt us into a oneness of
emotion, so drama and fiction can arouse and enlarge our
social imaginations until we feel the common nature in
people who before seemed strange or hostile to us. In
this way, for example, Americans learn to find interest and
value in the many-colored life of immigrants from Europe.</p>

<p class='c013'>For much the same reason any high kind of social organization,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>one that lives in the spirit of the people and
is not a mere mechanism, must exist largely through the
medium of art, which chiefly has power to animate collective
ideals. Those nations whose national aspirations
are incarnated and glorified by poetry and painting may
justly claim, in this respect, a higher civilization than
those whose achievements are merely political, scientific,
and industrial. If democracy is to do for the world all
it hopes to do, it must develop greatly on this side; especially
since a system that is to be worked by the masses
is peculiarly dependent upon the diffusion of its ideals.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is the closest possible relation in principle between
the idea of art and that of democracy. The former,
like the latter, exalts the inner self-reliance of the individual,
saying “look in thy heart and write,” or paint,
or sing, or whatever the mode of expression may be.
The artist, in the act of creation, is always free, he is
attending to, bringing to clearness and realizing that
which is revealed to him alone, unfolding his highest individuality
in the service of the whole, precisely as each
citizen is called to do in a real democracy. And in fact
there is nothing more democratic than a community of
artists, just because of their preoccupation with what is
intrinsic and individual.</p>

<p class='c013'>Moreover the art spirit, accustomed to cherish individuality,
tends to make us impatient of social conditions
that are hostile to it. It hates repression and demands
democracy as the basis of tolerable living. If we find
that our fellow citizens lack self-expression our own life
participates in their degradation. It is hardly imaginable
that a real artist should be a formalist or a snob.
The fact that we are so largely content with products
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>that have no art or individuality in them really indicates
a lack of higher freedom in ourselves, a low sense of personality
and a domination by lifeless conventions.</p>

<p class='c013'>If artists and lovers of art are often conservative as
regards projects of social improvement, this may perhaps
be ascribed to the need of sensitive natures for tranquillity,
or to their sense of the value of conventions as a
foundation for perfected works.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is true that art culture requires leisure, but not more
than we all ought to have, or than the majority, even
now, do have. And idleness is hostile to it, because spiritually
unhealthy. A man who is in the habit of doing
an honest day’s work, manual or intellectual, will be in
a better state to appreciate music or painting, other things
equal, than one who is not. His whole being is more
normal, more ethical, better prepared for a higher life.
And so private wealth is often more a hindrance than a
help.</p>

<p class='c013'>If there be truth in the idea that only a minority can
share the life of art, which is questionable, at any rate
this minority, in a democratic society, will be one not of
wealth or exceptional leisure, or even of education, but
of intrinsic sensibility.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are those who think that something wholly new
is to be looked for in an art of democracy, and I suppose
that in fact a larger human spirit will be found in the
ideals it expresses or implies, just as every social product
must reflect the spirit of the age. I do not see, however,
that the general conceptions and methods of art, as the
great tradition brings them to us, require any change.</p>

<p class='c013'>Certainly art will never be commonplace or uniform,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>but always select, distinctive, and as various as life—even
as democracy itself is a larger expression of human nature,
and not the vulgarizing thing that its opponents have
tried to make it out.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nor will art ever be cheap, in a spiritual sense, and if it
is so in a material sense it will be because it is supported
and diffused by the community. Devotion to an ideal,
material sacrifice, and the higher self-reliance, will always
belong to the career of a real artist, as they always have.
And as to the appreciator, he must earn his joy by attention,
self-culture, and virtue. The only way that masses,
under a democratic or any other order, can rise into a
higher life, is by becoming worthy of it. A best seller or
a motion-picture show appealing to the superficial and undisciplined
sentiment of a million people is not the art
we look for, though it may be better than none at all. I
take it that we should try for a real culture and self-expression
without concerning ourselves primarily with
numbers, beyond providing for the diffusion of opportunity.
Walt Whitman’s verse, so far as it is a noble
expression of freedom and brotherhood, is good democratic
art, though it has never been popular; but there
is nothing especially democratic about the crudity which
impairs it; and our New England poets are in no respect
more truly American and democratic than in a moral refinement
scarcely matched in any other school. If we
are to have a form of art that is good in itself and also
popular, this will come about, I suppose, by the mutual
influence of a line of artists and an appreciating public,
each educating and stimulating the other, until the
movement penetrates the mass of the people, as has been
the case with certain forms of art in Renaissance Italy,
or in contemporary France.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>We must not forget that democracy is itself one of the
arts of a free people. I mean that the common man may
find expression in a varied, intelligent, and joyous participation
in the community life, outside of working-hours;
in the conduct of towns, churches, schools, and other
popular institutions, and in communal sports and recreations.
There is a great deal of this now, and the possibilities
are infinite.</p>

<p class='c013'>And along with this we need a real art of democratic
intercourse, disciplined and considerate, which shall give
all of us the joy of self-expression and of feeling that
others are expressing themselves in like freedom.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are many who doubt whether self-expression, and
therefore an art spirit, is possible along with the specialization
of modern work. But it is not clear that specialization
as such can destroy this spirit, even in the task itself,
provided one is conscious of working for a worthy
whole. The mediæval cathedrals were built by groups
of masons, each of whom, no doubt, had his own special
and for the most part humble task. If all shared the
productive joy, as it is thought they did, it must have
been because the work as a whole appealed nobly to the
imagination, because there was fellowship and <em>esprit de
corps</em> among the members of the group, and because each
man felt free to use his intelligence and taste within his
own sphere. If your work is suited to you, and you
delight in the whole to which it contributes, the chief
conditions of an art spirit are present.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is not so certain as is often alleged that modern factory
work, in its actual detail, is and must remain mere
drudgery. In general, it is good management to give a
man the most intelligent work he is fit for, and, in general,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>this kind of work will evoke most interest and self-expression.
Much of what appears to be drudgery to an
onlooker is not really so—there is commonly more room
for skill and individuality in manual work than is apparent
from the outside—and what is really so should
tend to be eliminated by better training and placing, more
considerate management, a better spirit of co-operation,
and other probable improvements.</p>

<p class='c013'>No doubt the free play of individuality, for most of us,
must be sought outside of working-hours, but there should
be something of self-expression and the spirit of art in all
work.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perhaps the greatest weakness of our idealism is that
it does not imagine living social wholes. So strong is the
individualist tradition in America and England that we
hardly permit ourselves to aspire toward an ideal society
directly, but think that we must approach it by some distributive
formula, like “the greatest good of the greatest
number.” Such formulas are unsatisfying to human nature,
however justly they may give one aspect of the
truth. The ideal society must be an organic whole, capable
of being conceived directly, and requiring to be so
conceived if it is to lay hold upon our imaginations. Do
we not all feel the dispersive, numerical, uninspiring
character of “the greatest good of the greatest number”
as a call to faith and action? It is like covering a canvas
with ten thousand human figures an inch high and crying:
“Behold the ideal man!” No number, however vast,
and no aggregation of merely individual good can satisfy
the need of the imagination for a unitary conception.
It is well to dwell at times on personal opportunity,
comfort, self-expression, and the like, but at other times,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>and especially times of spiritual exaltation, we must have
the vision of a larger good.</p>

<p class='c013'>And our conception of life as a race in which every one
must have a fair start, is useful but inadequate. It overstresses
competition and fails to set before us worthy objects
of endeavor. We need a conception more affirmative
and inspiring, which shall above all give us something
worth while to live for, something that appeals to imagination,
hope, and love.</p>

<p class='c013'>I think those nations were not wholly wrong who, rejecting
the extreme doctrines of utilitarian individualism,
have maintained the idea and feeling of a transcendent
collective reality. Hegel’s view that “the state is the
march of God in the world” appears mystical to us, but
is in reality no more so than our exaltation of the individual.
It is true that in Germany the dominant classes
seized upon this doctrine of an ideal whole and made it
an instrument for exploiting the masses of the people.
But we constantly see that great truths are used for selfish
ends, and we have a close parallel in the exploitation
of the idea of individual freedom by English and American
commercialism to maintain its own ascendancy.</p>

<p class='c013'>The idealization of the state, the impressing of a unitary
life upon the hearts of the people by tradition, poetry,
music, architecture, national celebrations and memorials,
and by a religion and philosophy teaching the individual
that he is a member of a glorious whole to which he owes
devotion, is in line with the needs of human nature, however
it may be degraded in use by reactionary aims. Our
country is backward, inferior to countries far less fortunate,
in the richness, beauty, and moral authority of its public
life. Our freedom is too commonly cold, harsh, and spiritually
poor, and hence not really free. Let us hope that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>no theories may deter us from building up a national ideal
of which love, beauty, and religion can be a part. We
need a collective life which, without repressing individuality,
personal or local, shall afford central emblems that
all may look up to and a discipline in which all may share.</p>

<p class='c013'>A deeper community spirit is needed throughout our
society. Our towns, cities, and country neighborhoods
should have more unity, individuality, and pride, with
the local traditions, art, fellowship, and public institutions
that express these. We want popular choruses,
pageants, social centres, local arts and crafts, an indigenous
painting, architecture, and sculpture, a vivid communal
life leading up from the neighborhood to the nation.<a id='r84'></a><a href='#f84' class='c014'><sup>[84]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Our idea of our country has plenty of vigor but lacks
definite forms into which to flow. It does not sufficiently
connect with real life, and, in ordinary times, is too commonly
ineffective in raising us out of selfishness and confusion.
Our picture of the republic is mostly a child’s
sketch, without beauty of form or depth and harmony
of color.</p>

<p class='c013'>The direct and moving vision of the nation is sometimes
to be had in our literature, though by no means in
such various and familiar forms as we need. You will
find it, for example, in Lowell’s ode, read in 1865 to commemorate
Harvard students lost in the Civil War. I will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>not quote from it at length because its spirit is too impassioned
to be congruous here, but read the ode as a
whole, or the last two strophes, or even the concluding
lines, beginning—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O Beautiful! my Country! ours once more!</div>
      <div class='line'>Smoothing thy gold of war-dishevelled hair”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>and you will see what I mean.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ideals of human wholes like the community, the nation,
the Commonwealth of Man, merge indistinguishably into
the conception of a greater life, the object of faith and
hope, continuous in some way with ours, but immeasurably
transcending it. The human mind must ever
conceive some kind of a life of God or “kingdom of
heaven” answering to its need of a satisfying universe.
And this conception is of the same essence and spirit as
that of social wholes, which partake of this continuity,
make a like appeal to faith and hope, and a like demand
for devotion and sacrifice. If we put aside formal doctrine
it seems clear that the kind of religion the modern
world appears to be embracing, one which feels what is
upward and onward in human life as our part in the life
of God, is a kind of higher patriotism, hardly separable
from our nobler ideals of our country. And patriotism,
as it becomes exalted in times of trial, takes on a religious
spirit.</p>

<p class='c013'>It seems likely that social and religious worship, if I
may use that term for both, will draw together again and
abandon that somewhat artificial separation which political
exigencies have brought about. I do not mean that
ancient institutions now associated with them will lose
their separate identity, so that we shall have a state church
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>or an ecclesiastical state; forms of organization persist;
but it would not be surprising if a growing unity of spirit
and principle should bring the two into practical co-operation.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the public schools the children learn group forms of
play, in which they are accustomed to strive for a whole,
and to put its success above their private aims; and they
come to feel also that their personality is inseparable
from the life of the community of which the school is a
part. The spirit of mutual aid and public service should
pass easily from the playground to the city, the state,
and the nation. Along with this we look for a rise of
communal art, in the form of music, plays, pageants, and
municipal decoration, which shall enlist the feelings and
hallow the larger life with cherished associations. To
this we may add whatever ritual of patriotism shall be
found expressive of the national spirit, a spirit animated,
we hope, by membership in an international federation.
And it is only a continuation of this enlarging membership
and service to go on, by the aid of symbols and worship,
from these visible social wholes to the invisible wholes,
also social, of religious faith, to the Great Life in which
our life is merged.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the other side we see the church and the institutions
connected with it reaching out toward social ideals
and functions, recognizing that the salvation of the individual,
possible only through that of society, calls for
co-operation and service, without which worship is partial
and unreal.</p>

<p class='c013'>Indeed this spirit, whether we call it religious or social,
is by no means confined to the visible institutions of the
state or the church. It belongs to the spirit of the time,
and may be felt in the several branches of learning, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>philanthropy, in socialism, in the labor movement, and
in the world of industry and trade. The conditions of
life favor it, and in spite of all setbacks we may expect it
to have an irresistible growth.</p>

<p class='c013'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. Professor Albion W. Small puts it as follows: “Described with respect
to form rather than content, the social process is a tide of separating
and blending social processes, consisting of incessant decomposition and
recomposition of relations within persons and between persons, in a continuous
evolution of types of persons and of associations.” (American
Journal of Sociology, 18, 210.)</p>

<p class='c013'><a href='#r66'>66</a>. They are recognized a great deal, and with the best results, by economists
interested, as most are, in practical reforms.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f67'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r67'>67</a>. See, for example, the penetrating study of Social Value by B. M. Anderson,
Jr.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is curious that although orthodox economics has mostly ignored
the importance of institutional processes, its own history offers as good
an illustration of this importance as could be desired. I mean that the
spirit and underlying ideas of the science can be understood only as the
product of a school of thought, of a special institutional development.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f68'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r68'>68</a>. By calling these values “personal” I mean merely that they tend to
enrich persons; their economic character is multifarious.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f69'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r69'>69</a>. Production has a special institutional development of its own which
I shall not attempt to discuss in this connection.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f70'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r70'>70</a>. Compare W. I. King, Wealth and Income of the People of the United
States, chap. IX.</p>

<p class='c013'><a href='#r71'>71</a>. In this connection the reader will, no doubt, recall the work of Professor
Veblen along this line.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f72'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r72'>72</a>. Perhaps I may be allowed to refer in this connection to the more extended,
though inadequate, treatment of classes in my Social Organization.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f73'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r73'>73</a>. For a very strong statement by a conservative economist of the power
of class over opportunities and personal values, I may refer to the treatment
of the subject by Professor Seager in his Introduction to Economics, § 138.
Compare <em>ante</em>, Chapter VIII.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f74'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r74'>74</a>. Professor A. S. Johnson in a Phi Beta Kappa address has vigorously presented
this line of thought. He holds that: “The ultimate need of the new
industrialism&#160;... is&#160;... artists and poets who shall translate society and
social man into terms of values worth serving.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f75'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r75'>75</a>. The most satisfactory account I know of the stages of synthesis in the
development of intelligence, from the simplest assimilation of stimulus and
consequence—as when a burnt child dreads the fire—to the most complex
purposive action—as in the development and application of science—is
found in L. T. Hobhouse’s Mind in Evolution, chaps. V-XIV.</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f81'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r81'>81</a>. See his Hereditary Genius. Among other criticisms of his views was
a pamphlet I published called Genius, Fame and the Comparison of Races
(No. 197 of the Publications of the American Academy of Political and Social
Science). There is a good account of the literature of the subject in
Lester F. Ward’s Applied Sociology.</p>

<p class='c013'><a href='#r84'>84</a>. “The dispositions of human nature which made synthetic drama at the
beginning are ready to make it again. They never needed drama as they
do now in their day of exile. A community drama which knew how to
use these varied dispositions toward expression—not only song and dance,
but the instinct of workmanship, the latent passion which is in multitudes
of people for shaping material things into beautiful forms for social use—such
a community theatre would become a profound economic necessity,
would command kinds of power and quantities of power whose existence
we scarcely guess, would create a new social situation in the lives
of all those it touched, and would in time be the parent of new art forms
and social forms unforeseen, propitious, splendid.”—John Collier in The
Survey, vol. 36, p. 259.</p>
